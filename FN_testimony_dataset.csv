1,0,1,Tylerhow do you say thank you forhypertension can I just going to be in Georgia I got shoes you got moved again now my family you guys are kind of structure You Say My Name by doing up I always thought that as my given name this site until I got a little older and I realize. My Christian name is Frank. When I first came into the room near Alvin directed me to this chair I have a feeling that he's always telling me but that's his nature the set of his people to be the first one to talk I guess so I went through many experiences in the residential school that I went to I got a buck today in many ways emotionally physically spiritually random what are the day that I die I can recall very clearly is getting punished and strapped for speaking my language I was at Pelican residential school for a year and I went too far from the truth if I said I got struck every day because of speaking my language when I went to the school that is the only language I could speak and understand and I did not speak English so in order to communicate with my fellow students I spoke my language and the first day of us trapped I'm a rebel by Nature I just shat myself well I want to speak it again so they can strap me again and before I got down to the playground area I will sent right back up to the principal's office again I was the first day and then from then on it just happened a pretty well are recurring punishment for me who made me stronger to keep my language. That is one thing that they would not be able to take away from me and I think throughout the year that I was in Pelican that is what would give me the strength to stay at an end and I keep my language the end of school. I ran away to I ran away pretty well every week even in the dead of winter at 40 below iiii is to run away you were times when I when I almost came close to dying because of that I spent six weeks in a hospital 767 weeks because I freeze my feet and took me that long to recuperate when are the things that you know I can deal with that the physical the emotional nature of what I went through and really really bothers me to this day it just a spiritual onslaught of my belief system is it still happening today and I said because some before going into the residential school system my father my mother all the would be raised in a Christian family setting would always peaches for the prospective. God or the Creator it is it is too passionate God the Creator is kind God the Creator is so it isn't the kind of being that you want to get. And in the residential school system Andrew God was presented to me in a different light as being detrimental fire and brimstone type of preaching that went on prevented me from getting closer to my creator today because I struggle with this because when I see my native spirituality is one but I'm trying to hang on to it to hold onto but it's time believing in some aspects of the Christian teaching my parents raised me with the cultural component of my spirituality it is still looked at the SS something that is not evil he would buy my own Seafood by my elders because they've been raised in them by the church that their ways are ways were he and I I struggle with that tonight I work with young people I try to find a Middle Road to Nowhere to take the young people when I talk to them about the importance of our of our culture of our Traditions when I talk to them about the drum when I talk to them about the ceremonies when I talk to them about about smudging Wendy Elders of my community or in other communities here. I am talk to the young people about these things they tell me metric acorns,50.71,2.76,32.58,61.25,0.010335917
2,0,1,Alvin the filler doesn't cuz I was asking to make I'll just let me know G well my older siblings so I went to residential school I myself the knot the summer I was born my family in and two other families have moved from where they were living at the time and moved to start to a new community sometimes I think about I think about that maybe just wondering the reason why my mom and my dad did that was to move it to a safer environment and that's why I grew up and I went got there my father a Delta and my mother about the little Log Cabin that's what I've been there and it was and that's where I grew up and we didn't have electricity your or school or a store and there's ink station for a long time where I grew up in a place that was a safe and happy environment and I think my parents so sometimes I do think them whenever I see them they're still alive today for doing what they did but they allowed me to have you raised in a chameleon like that the star recently I was asked by the the TRC to to go work with them and the work they're doing Honda I considered the what was being asked of me and then and looking at the number of survivors that are out there that are still alive today and looking at them size of the country and considering the the challenge that the commission has to reach all the survivors no matter where they live it seemed like a daunting task it seemed to almost intimidating tophatter I thought to myself and I talked about this with my own family my wife had to say and I even sat down with the our children even know they're there only five on the oldest is that n I love to this was when I was being asked and he said yes but we felt we can do our own little Parts in the work that the that lays ahead and I guess that's the other commitment that the Commissioners and the staff that the TRC have to all the survivors at 2 even though we have a limited amount of time left we have a limited amount of resources to work with that we will give it our all that we will do all we can to finish the work that that's been given to the commission and that we will do everything humanly possible to fulfill the mandate and then I just wanted to share briefly and I don't want to take too much time here than just that when I started the TRC couple weeks ago a staff meeting at the officer in Winnipeg and I didn't really stay locked I just noticed that back and then the chicken I would was being discussed but one of the things that struck me about the meeting in about the organization was just how small how small it is in terms of the number of stuff that I left at your sea employees and I thought to myself you know what the only way that we can do this is if we work together first of all as a as a commission with all the stuff that we have there but also it to go out and create a Partnerships and relationships with the with the survivors with the families with the communities with the leadership and with organizations that's the only way we can do our work and that's why I just wanted to I think you for being here yesterday and then today and tomorrow and then we will work with you and the Europeans want to send as a closing as I've heard comments about even the elect of the event that was held in in Timmins said the TRC has come and gone and that said that's it I think the message that we want to convey to you too to you with other survivors out there is that is not the end I think we look at it as a beginning of a working together and then I thought I seen that relationship with deal with the survivors of that we will do come back and if we are invited to to the communities we will do everything we can to Toyota,71.98,22.88,23.44,29.61,0
3,1,0,"I'm one of the school survivors from the social services program and um I wasn't umÃ‰ I come here as a traveling survivor. And I've heard the stories and it's very hard. I heard my dad talk about his experience and all the things that went on but it never happened to him. I ask him if any abuse happened and he said no it was always someone else but I wondered why he was so angry all the time. And I was looking through the books, trying to find his name but his name's not there. But I seen my aunty's name there and sister. I tried raising my daughters totally different then how I was raised. My daughter's a support worker disabilities but I can see him that I see him. I see his relationship with his grandchildren are fully with his kids. His kids see he had a hard time with emotion, always do this get this done but I see the grandchildren laughing with him teasing him and I see him laughing back. Where was that person. That's what residential school took away from me. I didn't inted to be this emotional about it but um I just wish I never said this to anybody I just wish my dad could start this healing journey. I want him to come here and understand how after what I did in school to be a better helper. All the survivors that are here to share their story, took a lot of strength and courage. It was it seemed as it was I had to be here for some reason I just knew I had to come. And um, I just want to thank everybody for sharing and trusting me with their memories. Thank you.

7,0,1,All My Exes Live in I'm having a flashback good morning everybody I'm Roger and I'm an alcoholic I really enjoyed listening to everybody in them and I really brings back summer Pleasanton probably unpleasant memories I was at my cousin thought it there when she was talking about asking me about have ever been tracking the scrub floor in our basement the first thing that triggered was well we never had a basement I just told Scott that we were raising so I guess I have to answer that truthfully listening to what I've heard so far in my house at home there with my my family we do a lot of sharing especially around supper time that way we were raised that though growing up a lot of our communication was around supper table then though but my kids really enjoy listening to me hear the stories of the things that I've done the experiences that I've had you yeah they call me the Forrest Gump of Mississauga cuz it seems like all of any historical event that ever happened I seem to be in that picture I was in California in 68 during the hippie era then and I live in Chicago during the Democratic Convention riots I was right in the middle of their room I love Woodstock when that happened I was on my way over there opportunity to meet John Lennon and drink tequila with Janis Joplin and it just seems like this whole my whole life it's been focused on not being in the right or wrong place at any time so my kids really enjoy listening to those stories over my journey and then I seen that identify with a lot of people that that's soul-searching of finding out who we are learning our identity of the it's all part of house I guess that's one thing in common that we that we all have is that let's search for Who We Are know whether we find it or not to me it's not really important finding that P so I can be ready to enter. Western go away so it so it's a whole lifetime experience and dumb but I've had a lot of good good times and bad on that journey of soul-searching there's a lot of good things as negative the pain that comes with it but I think and balancing it out I like probably it had more fun searching for the good things sitting with the elders and go time to find out the what-ifs I guess I remember a charity earlier this morning about us about Spanish women you know would possess our elders and our community to send this to what was the real what was I don't know my parents I know they both love me Indianapolis able to care for us we weren't that we were in for a sense of not having a home food on our table we never had money I don't recall our parents me having me Rich but at least we had lots of love and our home and it was a lot of carrying those always lots of food on our table and the little doll with the exception of drinking a lot of that kind of balances itself out wake up Christmas morning and wondering if the trees going to be up or down or who sleeping under the tree let you know when we have our family get-togethers we always have to really good a lot of we see lot of humor in that I'm very fortunate I come from a little after what happened waking up on the stove skipped over big fight night before and my family so we were we were dysfunctional we were having fun but then I remember a number of years ago I was on visiting with the elders and I sleep with the owners in my community and I feel very gifted and honored to be a part of that Circle and to me it's a real big milestone in my life to be able to have that privilege of just sitting there with the elders and being part of group it's a hard part of my life to accept because I still Roger six years old that's always been a part of my life and I'll just took me under their wing and help nurture me give me to a level of them some sort of balance but it's okay but I really feel on it when I sit with them and I I never feel that I have them I have to hold back on asking questions with them I always put some really challenging questions in their way and one of the questions was what what was going on in my community and our family home residential school how could you people take that position and send us away what was what was going on in July last if you care for it and a very very honest with me I really I really acknowledge that now that the honesty that the elders have is it around that time and in my community it was all a lot of them if you use the term dysfunction does lot of alcohol and a lot of alcoholism doors a lot of them sexual abuse going on those lot of inter family relationships even with between brothers and sisters cousins and their children before it was an error on their Community where it was really it was really really bad and that's why the elders at the time they said these kids here they're going to get their things happening we did we want to protect them so that's how we got into some of us got into rather than to school because the elders got together and they wanted to protect us so they sent us out the resume to school hoping that would give us a little better of a life I'm also give us the opportunity to meet other persons like male and female and who are not our cousins or brothers or sisters who can have some type of the future so that was one of the purpose of intentions of the elders and when they told me that I was happy I was comfortable because that's part of our history it's not a happy part but it's part of our history and I was willing to accept that I really felt good when they sat down but when I told him what happened to me the physical or sexual emotional they were devastated my goodness that's not what I mean Asian came around you coming around a special I was I remember my mother you know Jason just like man down to drive we would have room what the hex going on and I didn't know the years of soul-searching and talking about what happened that time and I found out that it was meeting a chick that came to my house and tell my mother that I be stupid myself and my sister I was six and that she was eight they said they're going to residential school orders and be put up for adoption can you imagine that so fair with my mother with the broom chasing them down the road but we went to residential school that phone I didn't find out laws in my mid-twenties Steptoe how about that part of my life where I'm at just musician there you told me a ride you said you know your alms my brother the way I said that years ago are you and your sister are family will adopt you Vanessa family from she said to me right and I still remember your name Rodney Rodney lot for the musician too he said yes and we're going to adopt you guys and he was about my age so I still searching I found out that was around the time that my mother had chase this engine agent found the road with a broom through mouth so all those things understanding that connection that the what was going on during that time how much power that the Indian agent had if I have energy go to just go in and tell the family we're taking your kids you know that's jealousy you know what's really ironic when I do my disclosure it was right around the time that my son was six years old my daughter was eight and that really truly truly I was off work for 2 years and I told my wife I said anything that somebody coming into our house and saying those two are going to make it after school I was powerful spirit that we have to go through so the things that happened during that time it's just devastating in our communities that the Indian agent had that much power do that stuff and the fear that those people had in our communities and they still you know you called multi-generational effect we still have people in our community. Have that fear when are we going to learn to overcome that fear aisin on Council now this is my second term in though Let It Go world and I was telling her community when are we going to learn to overcome that fear of that you know we can operate without Indian Affairs that fear still there even are our front-line workers flower child listen can you do your job if you didn't get any funding well Berryville codependency 3D cell Lantern 13 million dollars and I chose our young people are you guys ready to tell Indian Affairs and all our funding sources we are ready to become so we can look after ourselves well I don't know that's the fear that's the fear that was put upon us to history when are we going to learn to overcome that fear so there's a lot of things that I have to do with Roger and looking after getting that girl to a level but I'm the same token I have to my children when are they going to do I have to pass on that now that's what I have to do and saying hey guys you're the Next Generation the Next Generation and I guess I survivors know is that our job at my job when the windows at Circle when is that link become strong so this whole Truth and Reconciliation think it was good it was really good for us I really look at the positive side of it it was really good in the sense that it opened our eyes it brought me back down to the level of hate grow up 6 years old because if we if we don't deal with that stuff we will never get beyond that stuff and it's very hard it's very painful very painful for me it was very painful for my family and it was very painful for my sisters and my brothers to watch this because my family we were very separated split some of us have some really traumatic experience as residential school students yes I've had some really good experiences my sister tattoos another student she would shoot residential school from grade 2 right after it closed so she's there for 18 years and she just everything was wonderful she couldn't feel anything bad about the residential school winter graduated high school and she got her college and cheddar really good job when the rest of us the weak ones when we started this closing what happened to us she's just devastated so it seems like that whole system with prey on the weak meow very weak 6 years old and the strong with the intelligent ones who had really good gifts they were the ones that were cater to that's really important thing in my family we had to really go through something watch the cape I'm on a roll here I'm sorry I'm just going as fast as I can that's okay like I said it really separated my family and them look too strong were too strong that really might have my sister said she had some really good experience. and that's reflecting over the whole life and she's actually passed away so we don't know what but she was up and down up and down up and down and then my other sister Hazel she she flew long life and she was kind of our leaders family and I met you had some really good experience so I'm what was the purpose of the 10 go to buckle and I mean really his story of I love to research history the more I read those government documents of what the what their purpose is intended for us as a nation of the people how to get rid of bottom line I can live with that like myself. Yeah I do a lot of cross-cultural training and I love you lady with makes me her number that's one thing we have in common we all remember our numbers that were given to us over there and our status card number we always remember the status card I want to do it cuz it's raining I was high like that I could you know there was only one nation in this hold mother that use that same I that was the Germans when they did it would confuse listen at something I said the same thing purpose and intent happen to us at the only thing they didn't do with tattoos like you did with the truth gun tattoo like that but isn't that something you know when you understand we understand those things that was the purpose and intent of what they wanted to do with this simple as that and I find real his store and I go back for the back window the boat payment what was their purpose and can't what was happening in Europe at the time before they came over here that's really important their purpose and can't write from Dale and here with to get rid of all the Indians the schnapps we're still here and we ain't going anywhere we may have our numbers you know but what I find really good today those numbers are changing for the mission of big names that's where we're making that complete circle we still remember those numbers but we got our anishinaabeg names we got our clients are coming back to us are forms of governments are coming back to us so that's been a change and I talked about that night where I am are prophecies they talked about it and it's hot so that whole tour dates poop infected our blankets are you know trying to get rid of us and I'm sorry that's I can live with that that was the purpose and intent of getting rid of check engine problem we got news we got news we're not a problem. I'm going to keep bugging you guys so it's really good maybe that experience that happened to us was there for a purpose maybe that was all part of our weekend it had a real devastating effect on S2 how to real devastating effect of those me personally I'm still going to that I'm still going to the legal the legal stuff because I don't want to give up I don't want to send a message to my children my family my can you do that on Twitter you're still a lot of issues in them these things have to continue but we don't tell our stories in one 10 minute session therapist I was a member was outside you're having my smoking that for all these magical miss wonderful thoughts come to me I was seeing my doctor when I first disclose tell them my story it was devastating to see a psychiatrist psychologist near wonderful moving along the doctor he died psychiatrist he died psychologist he doesn't look very good all the wonderful people that were there to help me God and like I said earlier no but it's good near there and they help me all the clinical people that were there to help me help me and then I really old lady love gratitude to them can I share with them as I share with the circles in the winter I can't just not my way I really have misgivings about having back camera really strong misgiving but who knows maybe I'll be a no problem though I have no more fears if I can stand up in front of the microphone for singing Whatever this is all part of it but it's really Indian all rednecks now because this is really weird where it is where it's at the circles weather for talking about feeling better be talking about I just said we have my medicines like mine This is how we do business this is how we understand and respect and love one another I really owe this is really good and them we need more of them I can't stress the fact that we need more of these things you know our generation were losing a lot of our survivors undertaking with them that wisdom enough knowledge of what happened to them and we leaving a generation in limbo relieving that next Generation those children my children relieving them with no information how are they going to learn how they can understand how are they going to grow so it's our responsibility to make sure that Legacy continues that's if we don't do it that next generation is going to be in the same boat we were they don't understand there to be that six year old child and dysfunctional so it's really important you know all the technical people that are here that's the message I want to send to them we need more of these services in our community he circles these helpers tell me we need more of them we're not going to be here forever so with that I see me but they just came to me in them good day,53.28,47.23,4.53,81.11,0.001880878

28,0,1,good morning first of all I'm my name is Ralph Paul if I had a ball that last name Paul it's not our name where Danny people my dad was called anywhere you got me what's on when he got married his name was changed to George Bell when I started residential school in 1944 that's when my dad got the name Paul so in the shrubs our clan system it disrupts our relationship with all relatives because of all the name changes that my dad went to first I want to take lady to my right or setting about some of these structures within the hour Circle Liquors I have said in previous circles and I've been told that there's no time limit in any Circle that a person for me given the opportunity to express their views their opinions in a circle without being interrupted without being triggered by time so if we want to use a circle I think you should eradicate time limits because I think once you do that then you are not in control of the circle right now because I'm speaking in this circle I feel that I'm in control not anybody else cuz I don't think it's fair to me being talked in value of talking in circles like this that I should be looking at my time and and and saying and giving myself I'm running 5 minutes no it's not it's not respectful to the speaker whoever it may be in 1991 I went on stress leave for those of you that don't know me my main profession as a teacher I became a teacher in 1959 one of the first teachers in the province of Saskatchewan of Aboriginal descent and every 10 years it seems that I I go through this stress not one of the conditions of taking a stress today was that you must talk to a health mental health worker or a psychiatrist I didn't want to go to psychiatrist because I didn't think I was crazy yet so I went to mental health worker in Pine Falls Inn in Manitoba todos me. Said it that say you're from Manitoba I lived in Manitoba from 1972 Rat Rod up to now I'm still living in Manitoba even though I was born and raised in Saskatchewan no just Health worker started asking questions who are you arrive love what's your number and all that then after a while he asked me if I've been to a residential school list of 1991. Almost 22 years ago and I said yes and that's when I broke down crying I've never cried cuz I promised myself when I left residential school in 1950 54 that I would never cry again I would never ever Harden myself you know a lot of us to do that we heart and ourselves away because the emotional things that we were supposed to grow up with you don't show you don't show your weakness and if you show your weakness and somebody takes advantage of it so as a result of that you heart and yourself because in resolution school I cried many times because I got beat up or I got slap strap by nuns and Priests scolded and things like that so as a result of that you harden yourself out for that and a 1991 because previous to that I had started really thinking about what has happened to me when I was in residential school because up to that point I've always protected have always defended the residential school but that was the only thing I knew I was there from 1944 to 1954 R6 when I started I was 16 when I got out now those of you that are teachers or education people or so I called you know that between the ages of 6 and 16. Your formative years that's what you reform your personalities form in those years does a result of that my my thinking was that I have gone through the system and I think that I thought that was it you know that was the way it was so I never questioned I had taken on the white man's belief system their language their food or culture and everything that's why that's what they taught me and when I broke down in 1991 from that question I didn't know why I don't know why I broke down something what's up triggered because that's when I started crying I started weeping thinking about my residential school years in the ten years that I've been now to delve into what it was like from 1944 to 1954 I will have a book out but I'm hoping by the end of this year and this book will give you an idea from my perspective I don't that's my truth that's just what I remember these are stories from Beauvais Indian residential school I do not try Caprice 20 buddy about you know what happened here and what happened there I'll let people judge I'm writing it so that we can leave a legacy the legacy of the residential schools to the people in my home area I want them to remember that history what it was like there's nobody that are that are alive now went to what I went through in the 1944 tonight in 54 for those of you that are listening there I'm 74 years old though young person but I have a lot of thoughts in my head even though I tend to forget some because of my age sometimes I'll get up here thinking or something by the time I get there I forget what I went there for so. That's part of the aging process and that's what I went through so them death scene as I came down here from Winnipeg I live in Winnipeg now is reconciliation somebody talk about the truth because each of us have our own troops maybe he forgot some of you at or less than is maybe he's bullshiting as you know but to me that's the truth that's my trucks that's what I went through if you believe it's fine if you don't believe me to request where you're free to choose whether you believe or not but their reconciliation powered from 19 it's a 1959 when I became a teacher I taught the white children for four years that was in Southern Ontario in st. Thomas and Paris and then Meadowlake for 2 years song to say that I'm you know hate it the white people is an understatement for me because anger is another thing that we carry the residential school survivors were angry because we have no control herself everything that we are is has been in doubt on us by all the people that taught us when you are told that the lot of you already heard it so you know I repeated the indoctrination that we went through that that you as an average of four you gotta be a white man and I found out that if I try to be a white man the white man look down with me so am I could be yet I'm an anatomy they call you don't wish where do I fit in I speak by Tank I believe I dress I eat like a white man but my physical appearance indicate so the people that see me as just another Indian because now one of the things that I did as chief of my community I said in many meetings as Chief where they have fun with Alberta what are the things that I've always told them was that we internalized our own problems we talked about treaties and trade you sent it but it's always the same people that have original people why not the other ones we make treaties with them so in 1999 we started the curriculum about treaties in Saskatchewan I was very sad because I was the director of Education with mltc. That time so now at your knowing to Scotrun your must-read teacher treaties so I think I had a little bit of part to play in promoting our own way of life now in Reconciliation Park I did what lot of us did I don't know a lot of our Aboriginal male people I married a white first white woman now some Indian woman and a pass out what was wrong with it at all when I was going to have you ever even look at me so you know so I so have I buried a white girl see some Scottish girl from Cape Breton Island she said she's from Port Hawkesbury so she's on she's a teacher I married her I had met her know the cross and we've been together now this is 35 years we have two children or we've done very well my son such as a lawyer in Winnipeg my daughter's for Sean I just finish your first year law at University of British Columbia in Vancouver so in that sense I did very well in a family but you gotta remember you have to remember that I never grew up in a family I never grew up in the family situation where there is love and affection and tenderness I never grew up like that I grew up in a very very impersonal surrounding atmosphere environment it was very impersonal and I tried to give me an idea of all the thinking that I did wide was so being married to a white girl I can't say I hate white people and I can't say that because when my wife is a white woman but what would you say if I said I hate you but we've got a long wait been together 35 years and all and wait we've done very well she's still teaching and for those of you that may be the first time that's why first profession as a teacher I became a teacher 1959 when it wasn't very popular for Aboriginal people to get into that profession so I called right after 95 and then I became superintendent of Education everyday my PC for eight years and then the last four years from 07 to 02 11 always chief of Patrick job done a lot in my time time my time is getting shorter but you know I'm still not the laying down my my pencils yet and I'm still going to go ahead no I just want to give you an idea of my perspective art for caregivers in the forties and fifties when I was a young child 66e the people that were delegated their fiduciary obligation was to look after us but the problem is if there is any runs out here or any religious people these people these nuns and Priests never had training family situations never they didn't know how to raise children they didn't know how to hook they didn't they couldn't go up to a young child and say Ernest I love you they couldn't do that because to them they're renounced at either one of their votes they renounce things under three of them that they took three vowels that they took and the three vowels are poverty these religious people owned nothing so they preach to us they told us that money is the root of all evil that if you want to make money then you're forgetting God the Blessed Virgin Mary and all over holy people that they believe in what does poverty put them in a situation where you cannot own anything the only thing you own is the clothes that that's given to you so they caught us there their rules of poverty then the next one is obedience that's another vowel they took you have to obey because they told her some cells all authority comes from God because that was there they're thinking so anybody in 42 the place of God and whatever they told her you did without question so in a sense they did that was in in school you over you don't argue if you argue you got a slap slap be questioning Authority so then they start they started punishment they rationalize and they the I said it's okay to hit a kid because God is on my side that type of thinking and I can tell you because of my personality because of my the way I am I got a lot of that slap strap physical physical punishment but the one that they really messes up parts in their Vive Chasity they renew that they renounce their own sexuality these people priest couldn't father children nuns couldn't couldn't get babies because it was sent to them so if it was sent for them to think about sex that passed it on to us NFL result of that we got a very warped idea what sex is about in in our lives but it but yet it's an integral part of who we are nearby motels on procreate General sell the Earth but yet they are the ones that renounce that and yet they pass it on to wash one of the stories I told in my book is about we have inclinations like any human beings if I if I like a girl I like her looks. You know it's an attraction it's normal normal magenta remember this this guy passing a note to a girl and a nun call them hold a grudge.. I thought that was the end of the world she was yelling and right now and then call another none these two people were put in front there and ridiculed for just passing a note in expressing how this boy like this girl so that's the kind of thinking that we went to I'm not going to cry today because I've done my crying if you want to cry and laugh that's fine now I told Chief here did you ever see Jesus smile did you ever see Jesus laugh come on I'll just think why is that is he a happy person or a miserable person because we were endowed we were told that Jesus is the savior he is God and all that Mike yet why is any smiling why is any happy why isn't here hugging children so this is something that I want you to think about the punishments that we got at residential school it bordered many times on torture and if you want to try one punishment ride home tonight take to take books go in a corner imagine your six seven years old your hands like this and see how long you can last and if you can't last that you got strap that's torture to me but yet they they said that that is punishment to me it looks like it's torture my sister is supposed to be here but she hasn't come in yet but when she started residential school one time in church I looked at her I got punished what you looking at my sister I'm about nine years old I wasn't looking at girls out just looking at my sister but yeah that's how they characterize and your look it's sinful you know everything we did was sinful I want to take too much of the time here I got I got a lot to say but I'll have my book say it for me this book I wanted used in schools in my area Northern Saskatchewan and I want people to remember I was up in the email as a cheap one time and they were talking about treaties this was the third meeting that I had attended as chief of them about treaties over the work order was chairperson so I told him you know what this is the third time upset with you this is the third time I hear the same bullshit you're the same place you're internalizing your own problems we go out here and that's it you don't talk about it you don't call you don't try to influence others I said from now on get the other people here get the other white people we signed treaties with them let them come into the circle and see if we can convince them that the treaties what means something so at the same thing as there are some non aboriginals here but the age group the ones that are in their late teens or early twenties are not around I know we're doing a good job in a sense that even there is totaled said if you want a person to changed to do something get them while they're young and guess what they did to us they got us while they're young that's why we're like that so that's what you need to do and then I told him a story they were in this mother had a little girl four year old little girl and she's out playing like a little tree four-year-old and then at supper time she called them her daughter to supper she washed her a little and then she came to the table and they were eating and all of a sudden and the little girl mommy Yes dear where did I come from no you know as mothers that's one question you don't want to hear and everybody's stop there looked up in you know it shut up mother said well dear if you finish your supper with tell you where you come from and a living so they finished their supper District wasting time trying to get their dishes and everything taking it easy hope you should go to bed early but anyways done work out like that so by the time it was finished it was waiting in the living room watching TV and when Mom and Dad came in there Xian Shi shoe with the other little kids out there they go to watch go upstairs go outside so there's a little girl sat on the floor and mommy and daddy started their there they're their little spiel about where she come from mommy loves Daddy you know that birds and the bees in all the states and the little girl is sitting there you know mouth open eyes and our son mommy you understand there you know and she should not have a clue what they were talking about what they were trying to it's right where she came from song finally after they tried their explanation well then the mom ass now. Why did you ask that question I was playing outside and my friend Melissa said she came from North Battleford thank you,77.96,13.67,1.72,75.87,0.013103038

30,0,1,morning first of all love I would like to thank the Creator for giving giving us another beautiful day today another day to walk on earth Mother Earth and I want also want to thank the grandfather's the grandmothers and all the spirit helpers that they come to help us everyday to try and live a good life and walked it Circle the crater had given us so I brought my meat sauce with me because currently off the government told me I was making when I went to residential school they line me up in the main area where that I thought it was a human so get that I don't know the government says I'm 18 but the media - this was given to me by now though and the way I understand it is you need to learn the metis sash soul to another I thought that the ironed it was a woman older and she presented it to me when I was at training and kind and a guy and Mohawk Country Inn Ontario High and that's where it was presented to me so I keep it close to me it travels very much because part of my healing I do role-plays I play Wii sahita I don't know if you know who is a key to his it's like really big brother in the Free World I think some people call them none of those there's other words that describe me as well so but he's our big brother he's our Jesus so I do role-plays to keep the stories alive in the winter time with my friend Curtis and we go to schools and they try to role play the role plays in the school so this is traveling very far many schools across the couch in Alberta and Manitoba thank you so I also brought my own personal smudge because yesterday III spoke a little bit at that one of the main areas in and I found that it was very hard to find it anywhere in this place and I thought for sure that there should be a smudge of ailable but that's not up to me so so so I thought I'd break bring my own this time in case I do need it so it's here in this little bag that was also given to me by now though first of all I attended to residential schools and I am the second youngest son of 14 children August 3rd until I lost my little brother but I'm the second-youngest at this point in my parents are still living today and I'm very grateful for that my parents are 89 my dad will be 89 next month and my mom just turned 87 and they're still living at home healthy and supporting each other so I got very good role models and we we are um they are practicing very strong practicing Catholics and I and that's okay because they're praying to God and my mom had told me that doesn't matter how you pray you're praying to God whatever you call them creator so I went I attended all across the first of all and I went from living across the lake to order community buy a Beaver River there at 4 o'clock is what they called it and I didn't know I didn't go to kindergarten till I was 8 years old because my parents knew what the residential schools were about so they pushed the limits I guess we'll see they wouldn't send us until the government people come and told them that you have to send them so that's why I didn't go in till I was 8 years old and I feel that's what that's when do that part of my life story I guess starts but before that I have a goal and that goal it's basically to try and get myself back to the way I was from birth to 8 years old to be for residential so I was very happy have a lot of good memories I learned a lot of things I was very close to my parents but I did yours all that came to an abrupt and so I've made it a goal like a some trying to used iPod positive positive sort of way on the negative stuff that happened to me and I work and I work in a Penitentiary and I'm used to circles I'm using circles because I feel so that they programs there and I stick with her my brothers that are incarcerated right now so as I sit there we do a lot of exercises including collages and doing the life stories when I do that I take part with him I know a lot of people in the counseling field say that it's not right well I tell them I want to do it the way I want to do it I meant somebody was talking about Emanuel here and a book to me I've been doing this for 8 years and I can actually say hi I can actually I keep track of the guys at take to program the ones that they come back into jail in to the penitentiary oh there's lots that have not come back and you can tell the ones that have really taken on a journey so they have not come back and I'm hope the best for them but I guess my life from eight years old on is not a good area and it's tough to deal with high didn't start dealing with it until I was 33 years old from 8 years old to 33 years old I carry that with me for a long time and I basically tried everything I could to avoid thinking about it talking about it but I know it was affecting my life by very much and hi I went through a lot of fun different things including the substance abuse of all kinds of one of the areas that I always was ashamed of and no shame to talk about was the fact that all of my children are from different the mothers and and I didn't realize that until after I after a while and I'm not using it as an excuse but I didn't realize that some of the effects of being abused how sexually abused as those types of things and I can't remember that word that they use for it the promiscuous I thinking I guess that's what you call it but I'm in today I've tried my best to do to heal and to heal the relationship with my children I have my oldest son is. 29 now and my second oldest is 26 will be 26 actually so what I told him as I sat them down and I told him my life story and I explain to them that's what I went through when they were old enough when were they were both 16 and I asked him I said to consider it I'm not going to tell you not to use alcohol you make your own decision but also be prepared if you're going to be a dad you know because I was not and I wasn't able to give you a good parenting like that should have been able to put but I did the best I could not have a very good relationship with my son's at this point and they've given me a grandson and granddaughter but I guess that's what we did to realize is we need to talk about those things that that hurt and it's painful and I realize that but the more I talk about it the less painful it becomes but as I said I cured it for 25 years and I was tired of it and it was affecting my relationships and respecting everything then today I can look at it I can look at it as my strength actually it's made me who I am today and I think I believe that I'm strong I believe I believe I can beat it I can deal with it and have a positive life and actually achieve my goal which is that first eight years of my life that I don't know if I'll get exactly that way but it was a good life but it was all taken away it's good though because I understand that and I was victimized at a very young age Lunette 25 years I didn't realize I realized today that I kept myself as a victim I was me that the kept myself there but I didn't know I didn't know how to move out of there and then after 25 years when I began to talk about it that's why I became a survivor and that's one that's when I felt that sense of relief just not releasing my all of that that I carried cause me a lot of pain that time and I'm unable to go back now one of the piece at a time and try and mend was one that if he's at a time today I was thinking about being sexually abused causes sexual confusion and then that at one point I didn't know what I what what do I get to how I felt sexually and it doesn't work that way it causes lot and nobody wants to talk about especially when they don't want to talk about that I'm here and I build up the courage to talk about guess I was confused I didn't know I didn't act upon it but what I did when I guess I did act on it and to convince myself I was a man that's part of the reason why I would I get abused girls or women abused in the sense that go out with them and then leave them just to sleep with them basically an end that was a lot of money on my life and and you know I feel. I apologize I didn't apologize directly but everyday when I say my prayers I apologize to those people that I'm hurt and you know I didn't realize that I would passing at this function on to other people as well and you know if I could reverse it today I would be more than happy to do that but I know you can't but I want to talk about it and and help and pray and and do those things and I hope will help those people so it's not as as I said when I begin to speak about it I knew that I became a Survivor then and as a Survivor you feel a sense of relief once I became a Survivor and I was able to start not so much comfortable at least some really some of that burden that I was carrying that weight was no gone and like I continue to lie to try and to try and straighten everything I will not everything but trying to deal with things a little bit at a time so some of the things that I did it I went to I going too fast and the reason why I went to pass now I first of all went to elders and offered money on protocol and I asked him how do I how do I do how do I start this how do I start this whole process and the elders told me that someone is first things that you need to do is you need to acknowledge your your spirit and usually back before the Europeans came the way that they did it was that there was a naming ceremony that happened and I know I can't have a naming ceremony I know I couldn't be reborn again and start over but I wanted to do that so I wanted to know what my gosh. Name was until I made the offerings and the Elder told me if you want to do it properly you have to sacrifice yourself then Anthony proof do I need greater and the grandfathers grandmothers that you're serious about this so I did I went to pass and on my fast. I am some good things happen to me and one of the things that happens after I spoke to you the pipe and say any songs with the Elder stormcloud Brewing right away but a big thunder clouds thunderstorm so and then in the morning after I'd fallen asleep later that night the morning I woke up it was very bright dinner so a little yellow bird on the wheel over there singing basically tripping towards me until I said a prayer and I told that little bird I don't understand you but maybe in the future I will then he landed on my on my cloth my Yellow Claw and two two weeks later after all of this went on I went to a nice large some people call it shake attend and I made my offerings there and I asked out there that that was there too to get my spirit name and now so it was happy so not be with my name and translated in English is yellow Thunderbird men and the Elder that came in it was quite powerful I'm basically there was some I sorta but I know there's a lot of people in that room and it and those that don't know it's a dark room there's nobody could hear noises but you don't really see anybody and all I saw was the start of the tunnel I couldn't see the Elder but I was like everything else was closed off I couldn't hear anything is very powerful any told me about the he told me about my past what happened he said that the Thunder beings were there for you that day that felt good to hear that actually so and then I said that little yellow bird that came to talk to you said you were selling your something to me and so so that that's why the name of yellow Thunderbird man and also told me other things you said that the Maya money colors are yellow and white and he said that the Thunderbird as my guide my spirit guide and all the birds all the birds are your helpers and those are the ones that are going to help you think you're going to see them around any said that your purpose on this Earth is to learn as much as you can and help people how people to doubt themselves so that's what I've been doing I've been facilitating off programs at the penitentiary for eight years now and and it's good I like it but I have to take care of myself at the same time so but it's interesting how I went back to the start to try and get myself healed I get to get to myself today that gold that I have of that purse teachers and it's to me it's working out I talked about my two sons I have another son right now that though I haven't seen and I was married and divorced again so I haven't seen him since she was eight years old he's nineteen now and it's basically one of those things where every time I have an agreement of visitation agreement which is not enforceable by the police is what they told me because reasonable notice can be anything it's what they said so thank you so so I haven't I haven't seen him in a long time I think about him a lot I was with him for the first eight years it's funny how it keeps coming around because I choose all that happened to me and then I haven't seen my son now since 8 years old so I'm hoping that'll work out I'm trying I'm praying as much as I can not to kill eventually let go of the anger and allow me to see my son or it may be well come and see me one of these days I hope for that so and end in 2000 and 2008 I was blessed again this time I know I have a daughter she's 3 years old today and I believe that the Creator gave me another chance at parenting and so I've tried the best I could it was interesting that when I first found out about the my daughter went when my wife Persephone know that she was pregnant it was Robin's that Nest it on the tree with a birch tree right in front of my deck and everyday I go out there and watch was Robbins from when they first came there when it first started building the nest and how hard they worked throughout that whole time from building a nest of eating those babies until those babies were able to fly on their own and you know what they were there to have to help me so it's good to be in today I can actually sit here and tell you that I'm sober I did not that I have let go of the drugs and alcohol I don't touch those things I don't want to touch them I don't need them anymore there were a negative coping that I used and it feels really good it feels really good and my daughter and raising her the best I can I pray everyday for that guidance and to me that's what I need to do is all of that time when I said I was a victim then I became a Survivor and then now I'm building up lots of knowledge why did knowledge is Hyundai a Seeker at this point but I've done some peacemaking as well have made peace with a lot of things are still things I need to make peace with and I'm very very happy so when I work with the guys at the at the penitentiary I make sure that they understand I don't tell them what to do I just give them the information and explain to them this is how would work for me hoping that they'll understand hoping that they will as well I'll begin the healing Journey walking not the walking that path that medicine wheel that was given to us and and that's what's going to help us that's what helped me and it's important that I continue to gather knowledge so I'm always listening with both ears when I hear people talking about their experience because your experience helps me to heal as well so that's part of the knowledge Seeker I listen to the others I speak Korean fortunate to keep my language my first language is my shift my second language is Cree so when I go to ceremony and it's slippery out there speaking I'm able to understand a lot of what they talked about and that's where I learned a lot of things and I'll continue to learn those things and I'll continue to make peace peace with things I would no longer be a victim and that's very important to me so thank you very much for listening to me and I hope that somebody out there listening will be able to take something from what I just said and use it for your own personal dealing with what was done to Aboriginal people was wrong that's that's the first thing we got to say to ourselves it was wrong and it's not the blame anybody I see a lot of anger getting people yes there is anger there and it's good to get it out but we don't blame we are not that kind of people and I don't think her Elders want us to be that kind of people I don't think the Creator wants us to be that kind of people so I could just share what I have with you and other people and and hope for a good life that I can achieve that goal when I first started my life from being born to a eight years old those good memories that I had that's my goal in my life and an awesome one I hate it.,68.22,23.12,5.97,56.7,0.008205689

Paul's high school and I thought it to be good be different there we were good hockey players says the fifteen-year-old we played with their junior hockey team Harris to three of us. We're from Miss Callaghan and went over there and meet we played with their big team we have to earn our Stripes that's first year they was really good it was it was it was a little more freedom a little more developed yourself but they were still there hierarchy or placing Her Herd as I call it that he had to go but I was abused there by an adult I got my shoulder with open in the hockey game and they took me to the infirmary and while I was there Ali I don't know how long I lay there but my shirt was all full of blood and then hunting the idle came in you start rubbing my legs being 15 years older Zone Red Robin your leg feels kinda good it feels trying to wrong you keep quiet to see what's going to happen play let it happen Anna my shoulder still all scabbed up so just go shower

she went away for she left for six months and for the first four months I I worked every day but I was drunk every night and then I decided that I was going to quit so I went looking for help and I went to a priest for help I knew there was a priest goodness next town so I went to him and I asked him Mom bowlero on this is the situation and 100 went in yet a big bottle of Ryan if they've already coming come inside and have a drink at the only one here to leave that alone fronter that's really great Slaughter problems hold any started telling me the problems it created for Indian see this one again father and he wants to quit drinking, and it just so happened across the street there's a meeting going on and it was part of the group I don't know what went in the door everybody knew a man and everybody was so friendly I was almost scared to go in there looks like they knew me and he said I don't know getting the circle you find a place get some coffee so that old priest he stayed with me for a while and then when they were sharing their stories here all the sudden he was gone how was Maya my starting to quit drinking and and and then I quit my wife came back I know she was coming

an older lady from across the road I knew she hated white people too hun I went to go see here and tell her about my wife and I thought you was going to really cut up my wife until she let her go and she never talked about my wife she talked about me and said any know your timing and man are really meaning on women you should treat them the way your Coke um taught you to treat them if you knew Michael come and she said what are you going to do about Eddie it's not your wife's problem it's your problem not going to do something so I looked at myself and yes I know I'm a kind of you all these things are wrong but I didn't know how to have any feelings or to pick them up but anyway I changed my life with I quit drinking and I started helping people in my community and looking up I've always said looking at life different you don't have to change look at it differently and I and I've been trying to bring the residential school issue to the beautiful in my community try to keep up as much as I can and what was happening in terms of residential philco he had a residential school right in our community our Gordon Indian School who was almost a heart then the economic Drive of our community before and having lived in Muskegon at the hacker residential school from 8 to 8 years old to 16 years old 17 years old you become a community within that community does there were four other Indian families that were there and there was about 8 of us those boys from that family if you went to town or we went to a sports and the reserve we were kind of Outsiders we went to town we were Outsiders if you want to meet a community or at we were Outsiders and we have to stick together and you talk about games nowadays well there was groups like that before I don't want it would they didn't call her games they call this bad boys and that's the way it was and that's what developed in Gordon there was the south end the Roman Catholic the middle was the people that sing power and were considered the Pagan and in the north end where the Anglican and then there was a group of Born Again Christians that Brenda somewhere in the middle we were as Roman Catholic within the pagans cuz my mushroom was considered they're not going to church guy on his wedding certificated has the whiskey remarried Pagan Indian didn't even a man but there were two people that same power Union and did they give away downstairs and on those kind of things but as I grow I try to be cuz I thought the school can serve a purpose but I also wanted as a leader within my community to bring the focus of the school to say hey we can change things that happened there if we just talk to each other don't force kids to come there uninstall came there and I work there I know those boys that came forward in the Lady Di's and I tried to bring it to a community leadership and saying hey that man is doing something over there wrong I work there is a childcare worker and I put the kids to bed and I come back and check and he take them home or take them into another woman and I told him hey I'm as possible for those kids you leave those kids alone well after you're off work Eddie I'm responsible you go home so I went to my my leader at the time and I told him this was happening there in all this time I didn't know that he was also doing that he was part of that group of abusers actor there and a guy came to our community and found those kind of people in our community and put them in positions at the school Dune Abraham for about 14 years to stay in that kind of and that kind of situation anyway so frustrating and just stay calm and member of the community who was the shit disturber that they hate week we gotta change that and the frustrating part again is that after star left one of those people that was was part of his group of abusers became a leader of one of our programs and I brought it to the leadership and said a disguise was removed from the school for doing this to girls Eddie you can say that kind of stuff mini look around the table and you'll see two other people that were part of that that comedian that said he had to get away from the school earlier rostam hey you were there with me when we set a table and said he had to leave mmm with in that Community like and I say as a residential school student Survivor our community in a residential school in the community so different then I think I'm going to wait as an individual we're very similar as a community with a school it never leaves us and then when this thing came out that Wendy this dialogue started I went and shared my story I shared today cuz I shared this with my with my wife long time ago and when I told my wife I never shut your eyes to learn and nothing in about 6 months later we were having a quiet supper in I just fell apart everything just hit them I cried for about an hour I'm not a thing like that no and then she understood let me know so I was 45 when I went to my mom and dad and told them I asked him what happened and they told me why we have to go there and I never hugged my dad or my mom and and I hope them the first time that day so I've been involved with this residential school stuff trying to support people in my community trying to understand this settlement agreement and I and I really get low support from these things but as a Survivor and a community helper we lack so much and understanding what does deals about like us as First Nations people we look at our healing but it's all there's a such a larger thing that affect what for doing that paper. We signed and we got this money from we don't even know if there's this thing in my community Now call the personal credit stuff people at my community expecting money in your pocket and abused ourselves all over again and each other who do you think you're already saying I'm not going to get the money okay then it says right there are no cash value who was the advisor helper in a survivor he kicked around again by the same people you're trying to help in school totus this fight about healing and moving on is a continual struggle these things I think are really good but we need more after that we need someone to come and help us talk about this other stuff at a community is I'll go home and I'll get kicked on again for mentioning what happened to me and what happened within my community with my Community member give those people that abused other people in our community are still there understand doing that what does coke and Dagger stuff so that's my story of my residential school experience and and and sometimes I want to leave it over there but it's a part of me so I take it with me and everyday I ask the Creator to help me move forward we we have a teepee that starts with little Indians coming out here with all joy or sooner than go around the back in and Ender beat up and then you come back around like that then in at the beginning these old people said sitting together that we have it in Korean and English Miss I said together and we talk can we we we we have good things and we listen to each other and we make good plans with winning those good plans are going to be hard times and then when we move in on this side it says moving beyond but when we move Beyond those hard time then we become good people again Henry are good people all the time we just need to understand that so moving forward as a First Nations man in the residential school stop sharing with my family and my immediate partners my my wife and my kids my kids know my story but I don't take them with me to these kind of things I talk to him at home and I tell him trying to help them understand about being alone yourself I have one son who is very cold however he is learning to do do I tell each other we love one another he was home last weekend and when he left he said I love you Dad man old as I am. Give you a gives me a lump in my throat and I shouldn't have to be like that but I'm learning and as when I listen to old people talking this way we learn every day and just accept that the grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change courage to change me I'm doing that Plattsmouth that's my experience so I'd like to thank you for listening to me",82.45,38.94,1.55,76.76,0.010405454
32,0,1,hello my name is Judge Gerald Morin I'm amazing person originally from Green Lake Northwestern Saskatchewan drone metal late for those people who don't know where it is for me it's been a real difficult couple of days or a few days I guess being part of this this Gathering here in Saskatoon I'm going to a lot of different emotions and feelings and I came here yesterday and it wasn't my plan to come here and fill out a form or to be sitting in this sharing cericola I really wasn't sure what to expect that I had heard about it though being advertised in Saskatoon in quartz how is interested and I showed up and then it's almost like I stumbled my way here this morning you know like yesterday I filled out the form and then these different categories and I wasn't sure what box to put the my accent or whatever you know and I I'm sorry I put myself down as a survivor and I feel very uncomfortable about that about that whole categorization you know the whole thing about the language in labels and I don't know if I'm a Survivor or fun a victim or something else you know and I question whether I should even be sitting here this morning you know and it's very very difficult but anyway reason I put myself down as a Survivor is because in Greenlake we had a day school and they schools are generally are not on the list and st. Pascal School in Greenlake which I attended is not on the list of residential schools that are recognized by the government of Canada so we're not part of this in some ways I guess in many ways we're not part of the we conciliation process we're not part of the compensation package although I myself and probably close to have to community Ashley filled out the application forms and half have filed and and we did that you know what I was talking monster sells the screen Lakers that we should do this not because we knew we are going to receive compensation or when you were not on the list but we we started thought well if we do this then you know it's a good strategy to put pressure on the government to recognize this day school to st. Pascal School in Green Lake AZ as a residential school as they consider it as part of the package in and that we should be entitled to compensation they had the it's a Roman Catholic Community the church was involved with with the schooling there for many years I was there from for quite a few years when I started and I must have been about five years old I guess I can't really remember too much but when I graduated back in 1981 from st. Pascal School in Greenlake it was like I think that day or two before I turned 20 years old it took me awhile because the I filled a couple of times when I was in elementary school and I think when I was in high school I think I left one so I dropped out but came back and I think I was throwing out once so is there for many years do anyway many of us feel that these forms and and although I don't know why I didn't suffer like sexual abuse in in in in the school myself you know I'd I think from what I seen you was in a fair amount of physical abuse and certainly severe emotional abuse from my perspective Anna and I think the school should be included on the list they should be entitled to compensation they should be part of the reconciliation process that should be welcomed very very difficult you know with that kind of experience being amazing person do to come forward and to be part of anything to share your experiences you know you feel like God your experience is not not legitimate you know it hasn't been is validated it is very difficult you know I wonder sometimes that's why I say I don't know if I'm a Survivor or if I'm still a victim and then many of my people to make people are still being victimized from the way I see it you know like I just know recognition and many respect there's no recognition to respect us as a people in our existence as a people is questioned in Canada our rights are not recognized and respected their severe discrimination and oppression which continues right through this day the victimization continuous and I think you know I don't I don't take anything away from from residential school survivors those people that they have shared their stories you're in the last few days I think that must have been quite horrible to two to go to that kind of experience I just can't imagine but you know I think a lot has to change in Canada and I know for Freedom 80 people lot has to change and only there has to be recognition and respect of our of our nation hood are people Hood the fact that we are Aboriginal people are rights have to be respected you know when I don't feel entirely comfortable talking about that because I don't know if this is the time and the place but those opportunities to talk about those experiences to talk about these issues there are few and far between and and we need to speak out somewhere at some point you know if if if if there's going to be any kind of as I said valid Isaac validation and certainly Justice for our people I think it's wrong I think it's just terrible you know when when are we going to be able to move forward you know I didn't feel I didn't feel entirely comfortable even coming to this this old guy during the last few days you know I wasn't sure whether I should even show up this morning I had a lot of difficulty with that I still do but I hear someone at the meeting leadership was here yesterday and both from from the matey perspective and I I don't know I just think it just think somehow form 80 people in Canada something there has to be that recognition especially on the part of governments and on the part of everybody you know things have to change our experience has to be validated our nation has to be recognized our rights have to be recognized and there has to be Justice and I think one of the real danger is I think of people's perspectives on on this issue of residential schools are Aboriginal people and the experiences they've gone too I think there's a danger to put it into a historical perspective and say well this is something that happened in the past and it's all good and it's all hunky-dory today everything everybody's okay that's that's not the case I mean this whole thing is intergenerational these issues continue today to victimization continues today and also continue it tomorrow as well UNAM I think there has to be here you know remedi you know whenever I see an Aboriginal person with her 2-year First Nations or any wood Twitter I see it on TV or whatever I'm fortunate to experience whenever they do something good what you're at success it's something that makes me feel really good makes me feel really proud and I feel that way earlier this week I was here with my daughter Crystal migrating my four grandchildren and they receive their crazy money for the first time that was a very happy and a very proud moment for me and for my family but anyway I'm not going to really say too much more I think you are going to hers and all of those people who who brought this I made this event possible and I hi thank you for forgiven get a time and for including me in this process thank you,84.08,15.66,28.84,71.15,0.005256242

myself am from l'axel first nation which is in Northwestern Ontario IMO decree so I have the best of both worlds from Hunter my mother was I'm an intergenerational Survivor my mother went to residential school the Pelican Fallsat school and she was there for eight years as a child growing up I was some I experienced dumb a lot of the effects that many intergenerational people discuss such as lost a culture I don't speak my language my mom speak Soulja Boy Soulja cree and create her first language was cree and she did not teach me list my father speaks would you weigh he did not teach me this they thought that the language and culture would not do me any any good and that's what they believed so they decided not to teach me my language and sometimes when people here that I don't speak my language though I feel ashamed because I don't understand it and and that they don't understand that it was not talk to me and but right now I have the choice I can learn it and that's my choice so I'm learning my language languages so I have a few of them to learn but I'm on my way and fortunately might I have two children I have a daughter and a son and because I myself am went through a Learning Journey that's what I call it um and I went through this journey for a reason I'll just give you a quick background of of what I went through quite quickly my mother was an alcoholic and my father what was he was raised in a little tiny Community where they had to survive together so he was raised with the old values of community and relying on each other to survive and I was given those values A Lot quickly tell you a story here I heard them Robert till story about Tom unseen drunken Indians on the street well in where I grew up about five years old has walking Uptown with my dad and I seen a group of people drinking drunk on the street and I pointed at them because that I had learned this from my peers I pointed at them and said that look at all those drunken Indians expecting him to to say something in and agree with me but you know what he said you said they're not drunken Indians there people there and he told me their name he told me their history is why they drink and from that one experience I learned to look at people at human be and not to judge them and that was important teaching that I brought forward in my life also on another teaching that my father taught me was we went up town again this was probably about a year later we went up town and now I happen to find a Dollar on the ground and then back then a dollar with a lot money so I said yeah I'm going to go buy myself a pop and maybe some chips but my dad said well he says why don't you give that dollar that you found to somebody who you think really needs he says and I'll match your dollar for my dollar so I said thinking he's crazy I want to give away my daughter but I agreed because out of respect for my father and the love that I had for him but I thought he was crazy none-the-less so we went Uptown and remember that one story that really touched me and affected me about this one man and I seen him sitting there so I went up to him and I was scared I had heard his story and I felt so connected with this man so I went up to him he was sitting like you are you sitting like this so I went up to him and I said here and he looked at me and just that look that he gave to me it no words can express how I felt at that moment it was like I recognized him as a human being I was giving him a dollar and for me I felt like he felt that he was invisible before that and nobody cared so when I gave him that dollar it was the best feeling in the world I had never experienced something like that I was so used to keeping my toys to myself and not doing anything but that was a real gift for me that day and something I'll never forget that was the gift of giving and my father gave me that gift but them on to it it's kind of sidetracked here but from that teaching I've passed that on that's my choice to past that teaching on I've done teaching with my own children in hopes that they'll pass it on and that Phil gift they'll learn how to not to judge others but to look at people as human beings so that's one of the things that I took took away with those teachings with residential school get back to that and then my again my mother went to school and she shared with me her experiences as well in terms of by what she experienced a lot of the physical abuse emotional abuse and she shared those with me when I was young so I could understand why she does some of the things that but she did and I did not have an ideal dealt with by any means I myself was physically abused emotionally abused but for me there's there's another story come from story tell there's another story that she told me and it was about my great-grandmother they let you still live in a little tiny village and it was a Cree Village and my great-grandmother was 83 at the time this one Rogue whilst it was alone what was coming into the community and it was starting to eat the pets the dog that we're around and the community was getting fearful because it was coming in during the daytime and they were steering for the kids so the men from the community set traps like the Iron Wolf traps to catch the wolf and this wasn't working they had gone a couple weeks and it still wasn't working in my a great the grandmother what she had done was the she had said to the men you have lost your way she said this wolf is here to teach us a lesson she said it's here to show us that we must remember our old ways and keep them he says so I'm going to go out and I'm going to go get this will she said the old way so sure enough she nobody could talk her out of it either because she was the matriarch of the family so she went out and she she she was going for a couple of days and on this one evening all the woman had said to the man you have to go out and find her now because they had thought for sure she was she was dead so I guess they're getting ready to go out and find her they yeah it could hear some footsteps coming down the trail that she had walked and here it was her and on the back of her sled was the wolf so that was a big lesson for the community itself not to forget their way and so that story was passed on to me and again I passed that on to my children so that they don't forget that that woman's be a blood runs through my feet and I have her Warrior I am a warrior just as much as she was and then my mother who was a warrior she served have some pretty horrific stuff in residential school the other thing for me on my own personal healing journey I was an alcoholic I also did the drugs I did not leave a lead a good life so so with my own healing Journey as a youth one of the things that I had to learn was about my parents who they were so what I did was on there was an actual the first residential school gathering in my area I went to I attended and as I looked around there weren't that many youths I was probably one of the only youth at some of the sessions that we're going on listening to the stories of the survivors and when I listen to the stories of the survivors that first time light bulbs went on in my head a lot of light bulbs cuz you know what growing up I did not hear I love you imagine watching you know as shows like I was not sure with Beaver Cleaver Leave it to Beaver in Leave it to Beaver and here and you know I love you and seeing the nuclear family and in seeing that all the time how people express love you think why don't my parents left me because they're not saying I love you I never heard I love you I never got those hugs that I seen on these these shows I never receive. And I used to think my parents did not love me but you know what I learned at that residential school meeting if they did love me but they just couldn't say it that wasn't there when they have lost that ability to parent and I learnt that that day and that helped me to understand but they did love me except they showed it in different ways remember growing up we lived in a lift in a house without a toilet we had outdoor toilet we also there was 7 of us in a crowded 2-bedroom house and I a lot of times that was so it was pretty hard do you have your own privacy but you know what my dad would always say at least we have a roof over your head and your bellies full and that you're you're wearing clothes that fit you that you don't have to get from your older brother he said she should be appreciative but I remember my dad making the best meals ever and that was the way he showed his love for me my mom used to say or do you want me to go get you your favorite to your favorite chocolate bar or she would do something that would Express her love she had a different way of showing her love it wasn't always I love you hug hug but it was a different and I had to learn how they expressed their love I also had to learn how my parents were as human being they weren't just my mother and father they had a life before they became my mother and father and this is something that I had to learn about them in order to learn about me where they came from who their family was why they do this I learnt so much about time how they came to be the person that they were and that really helped me with my Learning Journey with learning who my parents were as human beings so I could imagine my dad as a as a little little person it was it was hard but I did hear that time he had a very disciplinarian father and was very disciplinarian and it affected some of the ways that that he he parent whereas he was was not much of a discipline but he was more of a teacher which was great for me he was he would show us stuff and we would we would have to do it in order that was the way we learn so so that was some of the things about my own Journey as an intergenerational Survivor in the way I healed again it was taking advantage of any opportunities that I could to learn also having nurturing the warrior in me and understanding the people that I come from like learning about the residential school system learning about the history that's where we have to start we have to start with our own self identity and Beast become strong in our self-identity and that's one thing that I have nurtured in my own two children is fostering a sense of strong self-identity for them they know who their grandparents are and one of the things about me is I'm the youngest in my family I was a young mother teen a teen mother and my parents you know what they did for me was they actually took care of my daughter and gave me the opportunity to go to school to get educated so I went out and I got an education and then when I came back it be enabled me to work while they looked after my daughter and when they did this they supported and encouraged me and when they supported and encouraged me I realize that I have a role to play with my parents because they were taught the old way where are we going circles so from that point I got a great education I had a great career I've done so many great things because of these teachings that they provided with me and believe me it was no easy Road sometimes I Stumble I fall but it's up to me to decide to get back up and it's that warrior in me it's a look at our people are Aboriginal people and I think of a time before before I contact pre-contact and how the the I guess Turtle Island twice how Turtle Island was before contact and imagine our people survived in such harsh environment for such a long long time and when I'm not averaging people came to our continent they discovered there was a lot of game Still Waters weren't poisoned it was a good place because we all lived in Harmony and in balance with our environment we only took from it what we need and that was something that I really respect about our culture and that we should be proud of I look back and I always say to my kids when prior to contact there were no big ancient cities or or polluted Lakes when when people came to this land it's because I knew how to take care of it and live in harmony with it and each other so it's that time that I would like to share about healing because I didn't want to forget them and I thought they were very important one of the things that I'm doing now is some my parents who are elderly both live with me and I took that as my role I believe and rolls and families and that's what we used to have traditionally we would have both and that is one of my rules as the youngest daughter is to take care of my family they help take care of me and my children so now it's my turn to take care of them and I also have two disabled brothers that live with us so I was blessed to be able to earn an income I was blessed to be able to earn a large enough income to buy a big house in this big house accommodates all of us and so I'm quite fortunate that that I was able to do that and with their help with the help of my parents I wouldn't have been able to do that so now it's my turn to take care of so the cycle has come around as well as my children I have given them a role as well I have always told them you are here to learn and you'll meet a bunch of teachers your grandparents right now are your biggest teachers because you have access to all their experiences they went through hardships they went through bad experiences and good experiences ask them about that because you're supposed to learn from also try and learn the language from try and learn their history they were people they were human beings before they became my parents and your grandparents learn about those remember that pass on those teachings that you hear from themand most importantly learn about the old values they have but my parents i-83 does gold because they have these old wonderful values of how we used to have to rely on each other to live to survive to thrive they have those past Valley and so it's up to my children to laugh also when are things for me to wait for me to survive and my children to survive is I look at it as my choice it's up to meet and Destroy destructive Cycles in my family I could continue drinking two to cope with past hurts but no I choose to live I choose to heal and I choose to and those Cycles that's my choice because now when I look forward I don't look forward to for me I look forward for generations of my family the way we used to look I think many of us have lost that ability to look at the impact of what we do in generations of our family and that's what now I look at any decision I make I think I had and I told my children that you have that power in you to change to effect positive change in your family we all have that power and it but it's up to you to make that choice what kind of Legacy do you want to leave and what kind of Life do you want generations of your family to have the biggest stem way I can actually use an example is imagine that first person in your family that took a drink of alcohol and got addicted to it what would have happened had they not chosen to do that so that's something that I'll let you think about but I was looking at how we feel because we're talking about Truth and Reconciliation and being intergenerational Survivor I'd like to really share what I've learned and some of the thoughts that I've had about healing and Reconciliation I think we must look to our relation that the four-legged the winged ones the insects to solve our problems you see they have similar we have always observe the behaviors and study their ways our answers lie there so for example an elder shared with me about wolves the teaching about wolves and how cohesive their family is as a virtual people a long time ago we used to look at the behaviors of animals they were important for us to learn about us I think sometimes we forget about our connectivity to one another as human beings but we're not only connected with each other but with all life on Earth can anyone think of one way that we're all connected to each other it's something you take for granted every day it's my breath everything breeds and we're all relying on each other in some way to keep Earth and life alive well connected and I think sometimes we all forget that and we all start to think about me and my little bubble I think sometimes we got to think bigger than that and revert to the old ways of thinking the other thing too I thought was the we must be as industrious and socially organized as the ant the end has a pretty amazing creature they protect each other especially the queen when something happens to the Colony they all band together and and fix things so I thought Beyond was a really good role model we also must look to the tree for our answers of Life roots is something that that helps the tree grow up knowing your yourself of identity who you are where you come from what what the beauties of your culture or how we're all related I think that's very important and also taking only what we need being balanced trying to be balanced emotionally physically spiritually and mentally is very important just like a wolf pack like if if they killed all of the Caribou what would produce later for them to eat okay and um I'm just going to quickly go through a just a couple things that I thought was very important I'm almost done our children need roles within their families and I think that is very important as we move forward with healing and Recreation reconciliation we need to take seriously our roles as parents we need to look at the eagle and the bear and the Wolf to remember how we should parent we need to teach our children to fly we need to look at our children as gifts because they are just as we are we need to change our or the way we think about each other and ourselves can I share one phone okay I'm just going to share this poem that I've I've written it's called the bird bird song past wrongs still hunting Soul Souls woman with a bruised face doesn't know her worth man with a bottle and an unlined drowning years of being a victim girl losing her soul to a small pill losing her soul to forget generations of pain pool of Hope only those able to cleanse themselves of paint red here moving on like smoke in a bubble waiting for the bubble of self birth to release the long tethered pain into the air of reconciliation and healing if only they could see how to get out of the me how to find the values of a long as long ago day that is Theirs to find along their way if only they could find the warrior that dwells inside the warrior who wants to be fed but his drowned beaten drugged stifled and killed instead do they hear the whispered prayers the one that go up in smoke to be carried to the Creator the songs that are sung and whispered and sung by their loved ones in Hope of a better day for the people that are suffering for that extended hand that will help them up when they have awaken from their painful Slumber do they hear the Children Cry ones who are here and those yet to be born heal our nation they cry so when they are born opportunity hope balance and Harmony will be their life strength and wisdom will once again nourish them if only they could find the warrior that dwells inside the warrior that wants to be fed to help the warriors on their way so we see and we sing the bird song make witch,52.21,25.93,6.27,76.48,0.004655975

37,1,1,good afternoon you got over there with me I'm fighting a cold and a lot of words I know I spent the day before sharing my private story and I know it took a lot out of me took a lot of my voice in my dream and I still feel that I like no there's never really onion 2 who said we have to deal with it now we're going to deal with this important my name is Ruth Cameron I'm from originally from the coast First Nation I married into a bear diesel classes at this time and I have my children here with me my daughters are you Roberta was there to support me close by I have my oldest daughter and Daddy and my baby daughter I need to so I really feel her to have them here with me today I want to begin by sharing with you telling you where I am and it's cool I was five years old when I was taken to the back residential school my mom took me in with my other sister and that's all team members my other sister and my other older brother and my other sisters I went to different schools than I did if they went to Maryville and then after that he went to some of the residential schools I can't recall and my little baby sister she was in the same school with me for a little while and I don't know after she went it is very hard when I go into the doors I could hear Children Cry and I didn't know what they were crying for so I just by trying to be taken my sister jumping I remember all the names two sisters that took care of me there and I'm Number taking us at the stickers to Calder small girls playroom and there was lots of other little girl sitting around and you were crying and I didn't know why you were crying all I know was I started crying for my mom because I seen her leaving and I didn't know why I was there new members also to a sister put in some money inside of a little black money box and that was for me to use when I needed to buy things I was there from great pre-kindergarten if you want to call it because I wasn't old enough yet to go to kindergarten I played in the sandbox and watched all the things going on in the classroom from a glass window and I could see my sister play all right if she wasn't paying attention I see her I see you're getting old buddy years and strap-on and not listen to sister my sister always protected me she was old and in with the Sea of course she's a bit older than me I just a year and she's a very quiet girl and I was the very active one talked it was so you know I never forget the strong relationship that I had with her because she took care of me we did home economics and I was in the crates or so you know she always covered up for me should finish my sewing for me cuz I was always getting hacked and I was getting punished for it just for me so it was just a little nun but you very very very mean I remember seeing my little sister sewing and she got her hands the needle went to her finger well operating the machine and die because that happened to her sister Misha was over a home economics teacher took her and strap your hands because of this happening to her I always try to remember the good things but it's pretty hard when we don't get to really talk to each other as sisters Robert Edwards ESPN punished or try to run to each other and help I remember when we have track and field meet my sister it was not a good runner she was little women Iowa said later in life she's a little woman she's a little sister she was just everything a little woman needed that was a little tomboy so I remember seeing running track and field in I'm yelling for her around in the rain running the rain the curse should get hacked and you know and did not laugh at her because she was a good runner so then I get myself into trouble because I was really bossy and very aggressive so you know III take up for her and then of course I would get better but it was locked in your closets all day or having to say the rosary but I remember state in the closets many times state with the stinky boots and winter time in the shoes the closest looking out the window that was there our meal time was terrible we have bologna made it to soup we had cards Panda Inn in there we do have little balloon is about the size of my young fingernail in my area and I would cut them into little pieces and put them in the water and oil to Bologna and that's what we had for juices for brought so we had to eat that and that was a very calming meal for us and if we didn't eat it you know did take it and bring it right back to us and we have to finish it in the matter how cold it was we have to suffer and another thing I remember carefully was it a real pathetically was always wanted to be in charge of being able to clean the sisters dining area because they had great breakfast did have bacon and eggs and toast and oh my gosh if we had a chance to do that because we we were greedy for it because every day with me that was flop porridge and toasting sometimes sour milk to use on her porch and we're really really you don't forget about and in the fall we'd always go Harvest corn and tomatoes always stood out for us because for me anyway because we eat that right till about November when all of the food and ran out the vegetables and the thing I never forget is in the kitchen area they had a pantry and in the pantry they had lots of canned fruits and pickles and what it is time for us if we wanted some fruit we would have to get money from The Middle Bank box that in the money that our parents left us and you know I know I know we were very poor at home so you know it is really sad because later in life I realize the government the food to give us in here we were spending the money to buy that that's fruit for a treat and you know I mean I know my parents were very hurt we were poor and you know it and I feel guilty for having to spend money that my parents gave me that my my you don't my kids work so hard for end there's something there was a lot of you know and if we had to read and if we didn't read well we were left that and the history books with terrible because it number sister would say 2 or so okay that I survived if you had time to read and then do a little history books I never forget it was an Indian he was dancing around the fire and sister are great to sister would take you as they survive you know and this is where you know I really start becoming more and there's a boat or I was because no one ever told me to be a problem girl to be a proud girl I remember free word listing it true Chuck Sarah and the sad part was either our own amongst ourselves are our own people our own young kids all of this you know we make fun of each other because we were making out of two so we laugh at each other's mistakes there's no respect for each other snowbound is talk so then we don't want to hear also that arise with a small girls medium big girls big girls wear the grey 12 grade 9 10 11 and 12 and the medium girls worry about the grade 6 2 grade 8 and then the little ones where that little ones that just arrived in to school up to a book grade 4there's a lot of punishment especially against you in our classrooms but they were little we weren't taught the way that we should have been talked especially now that you know I come to realize that we have to do homework everything was on the board for us everything was on the board for us and they talk to her teacher and then we expect this to have everything right but you know it was nothing really show me how to do it after the mouth is one of the most difficult things that I re I struggled with in school and I suffered a lot of punishment from it I was really cool that you lot of front of my street light other students Salata times at night time I go to bed and not be scared to get up minutes morning because I knew I hated that lost tons of weight but I know I couldn't because I see my sister and when I seen her brought back with four other friends and we have to sit marcher slipped in front of us is in a bit playroom and sister said Presley father Our Father belittle said to her this is what will happen to you if you tried to do with your sisters or you do decided to go to run this is what's going to happen to you so we saw him being punished I seen her throwing up the atom smoke even though I don't smoke I don't smoke and with my little sister I don't know where she went all honestly I don't know where she went to school in her little ears and then I thinking about 1962 we got a letter this is a ridiculous thing that happened 1962 we got a letter from Indian Affairs connected to my parents your children are no longer accepted at the president's the school or Cal residential school because you are not never know they moved from the reserve the car thing you are not real children are not welcome back and I thought I was scared I was really scared to leave because that's all I knew I was really scared I didn't know what was going to happen I didn't know where were so anyway I told my mom you know the stickers back and she said you can get this letter so we read the letter it said they're not and you if I knew anything was going to become about it I would have kept that letter but who would know we were great 10 students grade 10 and that's all you know what I thought didn't say nothing so controlled by anybody can Fair don't know so it is pretty scary so my sister and I were the first two Indian girls to go to work at the high school and one of the most embarrassing thing was because we had to unassign meant you had to find out something from the directory so we both we went home and I said to her the rain what are we going to tell what everybody tell Professor Hebert it was her teacher and that was great and oh my God she said I don't know she said I'm too embarrassed and I said no need me to I said I want to do so anyway I was always the movie one and you know what I thought was that Grand Theft Auto all day we waited you know and she's waiting for answers from us she said well he little girls with your homework to do it it's pretty hard for the other I was pretty ashamed that I didn't know how to direct for us so do we have to school we waited together and if you want we could talk and we talked to you and she was very happy with her so we told her that we did have a telephone and we didn't have a telephone we didn't have a we didn't order directly was so you doing it so we found a short time when it was done I told her we didn't phones in the boarding schools didn't teach you some things and she says well it's not my fault since we would have to learn how to use your telephone while we did have a telephone we were so poor we grew up there to room Shack that's what we grew up in you know in and it was very shameful you know that's my dad drink a lot too and I was embarrassed to bring my friend's home if they came with just sit outside New York because I didn't want I didn't know anything it's not beer bottles hanging around outside adjust the feeling of Oz and you were so it will be it will be talk to me and I'm so that's the way and my mother when my mother and my grandparents and great-grandparents went to boarding school so my mom was a real was brought up real strong Catholic his you know and she was Miki Sushi what it is her time for us to be living with her she's pretty hard and I should always say what the hell did you learn in school anyways you said sisters missing something and you're always praying like we did every day and there's enough for school too pretty of a day we did everything end in stan estructura wake up we did laundry on Mondays everything was like we didn't to boarding school and I didn't realize it was coming from her because she was in a boarding school and she's getting her Tweety taught us about sexuality was so confusing to end up when you're ready to go home did tell us oh yeah you know you don't go you know all around next meeting up with the boys and because you don't want to get pregnant Elizabeth peaches and I continued that every night I go to bed nothing funeral Jesus the devil's going to be coming soon so anyway it was a very terrible experience of even with two marriages I had we're very bad you know when my husband's both went to residential schools and you know because I was going to be marrying all these guys went to residential schools they should be able to have a great marriage is well the first one was very very abusive you know when I know my first husband was touched by the way things happened and my second husband you know we're just starting to understand I want to share with you was really important but you know I see how this truck for the day. It's ready to blow away from me with my children my children are brought up with their grandmother I was to give up a baby because I was told that you know you don't go around saving the family like this and the priests and our community and those LOL for worker I didn't know how to reach I wouldn't know how to read the child if it's going to be better off there so far everyday I wake up and wonder how my children were that I'm separated from but I never gave up I begin journey 35 years old you know what my mama told me be proud of who you are be proud of.

38,1,0,good afternoon my name is Roberta bear and this is my mother Ruth Cameron I am fortunate to say that I did not attend residential I was I guess if the word is the others I guess there's two ways of looking at it there's always two sides of a story but at eight months old I was taken from my mother's care and um I was in my grandmother's care and I was raised by my grandmother and I feel that it's a blessing in disguise I had two mothers I was gifted with two mothers my mother my grandmother I thought was my mother until I was about the age of 5 and when I got to start meeting begin meeting my my mother and my my little siblings and it was my older sister and I that were taken from my mother's care in to my grandmother's care but you know I try to look at it from a good point and I think that she only wanted the best for us because she she to her son was raised in residential schools and down she didn't have an opportunity to take care of her son and be there for her son her parents took her son away from her and them raised my dad and my dad grew up in st. Philip School and I never knew about residential schools until my first year of University and didn't really connect with it until I was in my dad was teaching me how to play Crib one time when we were used to come and live in our home off and on cuz he was an alcoholic he would go find he'd be working in Thunder Bay or wherever I don't know he worked all over the place but when he used to come home I know I just knew that was in a lot that air lots of fear lots of drinking lots of them running away in the middle of the night banging on the doors you know he's yelling at my grandpa's are a lot of memories that I share my dad and after he passed away button Nightmares From My from my father damn I love him though and I feel bad that he's not here today to share his story I know it's probably a horrible one but I'm glad that I'm here for my mother and able to speak on behalf of my my father when he was sober he did do good things with us sorry is getting lost a little bit here the only thing I really remember about my dad talking about residential school with how he mentioned um I'm mrs. Lambert didn't and I didn't really know anything about where you went to school and stuff like that and he mentioned and I just kind of said with who is mrs. Lambert niece of mrs. Lambert was a priest was the priest in the school and a 12 years old you don't really think to ask who this person is or even what it meant to tell me but when it all kind of came back to me when my first year university when I kind of figured out for some odd reason he shared that little that little piece of information with me for me to connect something about his past about something about why he would call this man mrs. Lambert and this was the priest at st. Philip school that's all I knew then so I kind of start asking some questions and you know within the community will my grandmother always took me back home to sundance's and I was always near her when we come visit the old ladies and hear about some stories in on the community and I kind of learn about who this mrs. Lambert is and you know and he was a a sexual predator too many of the boys and in the st. Philip's school and a lot of people didn't really want to go beyond saying that that's it you know you know you just say you don't know how to talk about those kinds of things you don't know how to communicate about those kinds of things cuz you pretty nasty things to talk about but my dad died when I was sixteen and died in a house fire you would drinking and he fell asleep with her cigarette in his hand and house burnt down or them but it is very damaging sweeting's really get to say goodbye to him cuz he didn't get to see him off the casket was closed then from there on we um I kind of grew up not understanding life always felt that it wasn't loved by my mom you know unfortunately drinking drinking was a pattern in my life I found a husband who is an alcoholic and I became one too Kmart method appealing or Giants and so are just guys aren't you feeling I hadn't done took it took alcohol for my mom and I to actually have a conversation a confrontation cuz we did not communicate my mom wasn't taught how to communicate and her truth and so I wasn't taught my grandma taught me to be quiet about things and you know how I was taught to respect not to speak not to ask questions but just to listen and I respected that I never never was one to talk about to my grandma or any any of the elders or anybody older than me but at the young age I run away from home and thought I found love but whatever whatever it was it was but I am continue down the cycle my mom had her first son at Seventeen I had my first son at 17 but it was a cycle I didn't want to continue onto I didn't want to protect you and continue on in my life I didn't want to give up my kids to anybody to Mom you don't any kind of system or didn't want my children raised by their grandparents I wanted that responsibility and I'm proud to say today that I raise my children I am am not may not have been a perfect mother and I know I'm but not and I'm still not today and I'm still learning and I'm still trying to understand I'm still trying to help them be good people help them understand why this is all this why we are the way we are and it just took me this last I took them I continue taking classes at University cuz I like to learn and dumb I was really angry from January to April when I was taking my class very angry at white people and didn't know how to deal with this anger and I had my mom to talk to I had my mom to communicate with and I just felt like I didn't belong anywhere I didn't belong in my own home because my children couldn't understand my husband doesn't understand me now my husband's about a respected person in the community and we don't think I like we don't think I like it all but had besides the point to him but the I have the have this anger that I have to get over and I'm very um IVIG before taking this class I understood the importance of trying to get along and tried to be community in trying to be respectful of each other where whoever we are and and I'm getting there I'm getting there but I did I did have a lot of anger and I and I had to do with that anger out if I didn't deal with it I'm not going to get anywhere I'm not going to get anywhere being an angry person so you know I feel good about them being here at the deer see if it felt good about visiting piercing in Victoria and being a part of the region working group committee it was a it was something that worked really hard at trying to ensure that our education day was something that was meaningful for children because it's our children who are future you know my children are going to grow up to share this information with their children my grandchildren one day and I hope my grandchildren are a lot healthier than you know my children they are healthier than in all the way I grew up there's just so much some dysfunction you know there's so much loss you know why I don't have my language you know it but I can get it back if I fight choose to it's not that easy it's not easy to find those conversations going on I'm still very much involved with my culture though I find it so I called her that brings me peace and Harmony but I do falter I do like to go back in I mean old old old ways are are hard to our heart to them give up some time with her old habits are hard to die and die I'm just really glad that my mom and I have had an opportunity to openly share our thoughts and and become who we are today I look at my mother my mom is my mother my respect my mother she's like my best friend like I can tell her anything and to me that's all coming full circle to me now I want my daughter to be able to hopefully then chili feel that same way with me because you know my daughter is a broken person they wish you was here my children grew up seeing violence and lots of alcoholism to and I feel bad and guilty for that I got it take those years away but all I can do is let them know that I love them and that I'm sorry for the things that they've seen sometimes we live we learn I don't mean to do that cause anybody any harm but sometimes it just happens that way I just want my children I want to I pray for them to change a pray for my grandchildren to live healthy lives they don't have any yet but that day will come I'll be there for them and I'll be strong and I just want to say thanks for giving me an opportunity to speak I didn't think that you know that I had anything to offer you know besides working in the in the school system might I do my best to work with the children and give them the support that they needed look at my children as well and try and get them to follow them the Red Road the right path and them I love my sisters I have a different relationship with each and every one of them and you know you got to be thankful for a

which were years old when they took me the priests would round the septic in a blue van receipt in the van comes I told my granny my shop on I was raised by my parents cuz they're both alcoholics I was on given to my our great-grandmother I seen the van coming and I went I went running to the Granny Weeno State we know if they don't talk to my oil mcdick win some money but I still go ran up a tree atomica Peppa Pig thunder that treat you get down here right now we're going to take you back to the school and I refused to go and then all the sudden the origin of pecan my dad at that time said no you're not taking her mosquito they took my daughter pic and they put him in jail and they said he will be released when you get down off that tree and come with us I didn't want to see my dad in jail get your scene I come down the tree I went with the priest we get there and you're the first thing when I did have a some days we don't be such a little girls to medium girls would be with them large girls love to time should we come back Dateline up the basins and I you know we'd all be just what would your bugs thinking Depend and sometimes you know it was it was funny but sometimes if we had too many bugs you know we get hit because you good see you in a white pan out and give Bug just hit that bad and I there's one day my granny sent me with some beads she said get these beads the father has them Silent Running up there the door swing open there's weather me show he had a kid all I could see through the back they had to the kid I can't tell you if it was a boy or a girl he was bothering all I know is that kid I could hear them crying I hope I telling this that whoever it was if you need me to tell your story to go on I'm here I don't know who you are that's there for me and I remember father me show coming struck me on the side of the head drug me off at her room when those leather straps are both sick but 1 inch thick if I got a note to hit in that room repent you

Super 8 which not like potato like cut up potato and it was just brought that sometimes what we would eat lots of times when I would go home I wanted to go home and not come back but I didn't want my dad to be jailed again all through my years I kept thinking if I never say anything to anybody if I take this back to the Creator we agreed don't know but as an adult you you start to have kids you start remembering stuff you have triggers you're taking but you're passed by so many people you're forced to deal with things that you don't want to deal with their there my my life growing up with my grandparents was really good however the residential schools we're tough we did lots of stuff to to try and make it happen and we ended up getting the kids for it I think I was some of my friends that went to school with how they take up different stuff in their lives different religions I don't know if it's just a mask the pain that they're in or for them to just shoot themselves away from society some of them don't come home Amaya when I was done with residential schools 1971 they tear down that building ironically when I sat there and watched it go down it was my husband with a bulldozer that was bulldozing that's cool how I cried know how I thought but be as I don't have to share my story with anybody I don't have to say anything it's done with but you know it's not that easy things come up I'm human and sometimes my way of dealing with it hasn't been good I've been involved with drugs alcohol you know I didn't have much respect for myself although I was raised with respect but I lost it somewhere you know if I only have 2 kids I don't want kids I have my daughter behind me I've told her that that was something I didn't want my life with kids cuz I've been through hell and back and I was going to raise any kids so anybody could torment him to wait we were enough is enough if I could stop at that means that I could I wouldn't need to have any kids of my life but today I'm very grateful the Creator gave me two kids have a son who isn't here he's at home and I have my daughter behind me what's on struggles because of the way. I hit my kids the way I was treated I have pulled their hair I hope punched I have dried blood I have been very Erin Shannon butcher when I raise my kids my son's an alcoholic is abusive and you know I remember growing up I didn't want to raise up a homosexual so many times I play with him and punch him and say you got to be tough enough to handle it I was raised to be tough I raised my son that way he's not going to be probably in the prison system though at what point do I take responsibility what point do I give it to him because as a child growing up I didn't bond with my mom I didn't with my parents have on it with nuns and Priests that were abusive so that's how I treat my kids my son is 23 my daughter behind me is going to be 20 I raised them with an iron fist that's something that I'm proud of not something I can read traktory do I could see if I was so worried to voice but they're struggling with that I know they hurt I've been with the same spot for the past 33 years if he was here he would tell you that I was a very abusive woman like I said I'm I'm not happy the way I am treated my post I just was so much when you thought growing up because my parents were really violent too abused me my spouse what course of life is take me to different different stuff where I have been forced to deal with certain stuff that come up where I work sometimes we take off positions and I went back thinking in my life I was in residential schools for seven years after that I tried to live with my father who is an alcoholic I was lost to the over to Ministry and I was placed and 13th foster home in those homes I was physically abused sexually abused I went to court for that rape and only to know that there are predators out there that you think you can trust and they're there they're working out I don't know how is a parent you can protect your own kids from predators such as the man that had raped me then left me naked on on the road and what Taskmaster they're wanting somebody to pick me up but what was I is the dirty little Indian kid don't be scared to stop on finding somebody did stop I have no clothes on you pick me up my foster home from there I said to myself after all of that going through all the tests of being a rape victim you have to I have to be driven to the high school by RCMP kids always I would wait what you would use so special about I don't go but today I'm riding in the car with special it wasn't for me I left them after 13 homes from one Province to another I so I've had enough I'm tired and you're 15 it went out my own I lived in Saskatoon in a tiny little room Winter High School try to forget about my past but it would cheating on me because of the kind of friends people that I hung I said somewhere along the line and I remember talking to an older he relates me that tomorrow I said you know if there's something I could do to change I would do it I didn't know what I wanted to do and then I realize that I was not only a big and a survivor of residential school but also a child in care Men at Work children across the country are so free and care so I went home to complete my degree in social work so I do that kind of work now I see kids and I see myself in them I work from my heart they say is social workers you have to work from here but pretty hard you have to work from here to preserve some of them don't have parents some of them don't what their family to their they're not wanted and these are kids that week we take care of so I've been doing that for the last so many years oh my my mission statement is that Wendy's kids are silent when nobody wants to hear them as a child growing up and so many homes I said when I grow up I want to be that voice Brittany children but you know it's just stuff I meant We Wish Justin of being our stuff come on tonight would give much to dance as well but when would they need gun it's hard not knowing what your future will hold your kids when you let them go in the way I feel I have both my kids with me on my son his try to have relationships but they didn't work so I have both my children living with me and I can live with me until the Creator calls me home I don't know I'm selfish I don't want them to go away from me because I was pushed away so many times for my own family my mother died of an alcohol disease or suffer for 14 years until she was called home remember my daughter behind me we're sitting there waiting for her to see somebody suffer like that and I didn't really know her I knew of her I tried to get to know her in the last 10 maybe 14 years of her life but that's not even enough to know who your parent do some of us are fortunate to have our parents all her life to know them in that capacity I didn't that's why I said I would always be there for my kids but in some ways I wasn't there for them Genoa I didn't know if I could do this coming here because I just felt I was asking a lady well I wanted to go to a session to hear other people story well however the miscommunication is I am here sharing my story with you folks I believe that sometimes things turn out for a reason and this must be one and I'll take your for that I just think every each and every one of you for listening I ask that you pray for all the children first and foremost the children that were affected by residential schools and the children who are still in care cuz I just another transition from residential schools is keeping them in in care and not being with their families also like to thank my supporters behind me I've had a lot of work but there's still a lot of stuff that I feel indirectly for kids I see that I work with and it's it's for them that I work for not for myself I just think the Creator each and every day I wake up and I see the sun I see it on the greatness of life and he hasn't called me home my work is not yet done I thought I'd like to thank you all I had asked my mom about you,94.23,18.43,2.24,77.65,0.015760441
41,1,1,thank each of you for sharing and as each one was talking to it reminded me a picture of parts of my life each and every one I think we all carry a little bit of each other stories maybe not the same I know I was in residential school for three years but sometimes it feels like it was through it it was a long time when things happen and I remember younger kids crying you could hear them crying at night sometimes and you had a brother or sister summer behind the wall but you couldn't go to them that would done until I left there and live in the residential school I went to another school or into another convent not calling when I left there I thought it was going to come out and be a nun I suppose the only thing I knew I wanted to be a nun but it ended up Ryan. I landed in Boston I'm sorry I met a person he was really nice we ended up getting married and I was pregnant next one three months after you got married that's when I started to get beat up that continue until 1969 I ended up having to place my children for protective custody I went to court for six years never got them back he became an alcoholic and also a drug addict whatever and it was like starting one day and then stopping one day when it was nothing left to lose that's what I felt so I stopped and now all I had was like what I had on my back of me the clothes and SOB bag I had a few things left so I work tonight I went and I went back to school late and then I move on I move back to Canada and I figured from here are you know I am back to the community anaconda versus Catholic medical community and trying to fit in I ended up going back to church I had gone to church in 20 years and they got the residential school how many came back was trying to fit in fit in with my mother my family I didn't know my family it was 13 and my family but neither was went to the residential school then I got married a second time I always like to Joe as I was happily married on he couldn't deal with it I have my son and now he was seven years old and finally we have we lived in the car for 2 months till we got an apartment but I suppose I'm like having a second chance but I couldn't do nothing for my other three girls they felt like with my son I want to believe and we're still together me and my son he's 25 today and he's a pretty good follow-up prices of living in the community and trying to work with residential school survivors my main thing was survivors in it and I think my kids grew up with them I have a daughter that came home when she was 16 she came back in back of the community I didn't we didn't really know each other I knew she was my daughter and she knew where she was I was her mother and we fought for about 13 years why I left your way I'd honestly I don't know find me when I was going to KMart I was sick and she came in and she says I feel like you're hitting you or whatever and I was about to take your best shot but I'm not going to guarantee you I would hit you back by get up but I say so we can sit down and talk so he said we talked for about 4 hours does anything you want to know tell me are you know whatever our system I'll answer you but it was like I had to give her that time too for her to tell me what she felt how she was feeling and Ice is like a everything I did it was true and so I don't know but I also told her that the time I visited that was all I could do but I didn't handle things the way I should have liked instead of getting help I ended up drinking and drinking more and it went on till when I get to stop but I've been sober now for a nano 30 something years and if you had told me back in the sixties that you be sober and working in an addiction Center what is that are you crazy but I'm I've been at the Addiction Center now for 20 years and I said I've been pretty lucky guy says that my young my boss is allowed me to go to he'll have to find other survivors and today I work with residential school survivors I've been working there for I don't know how long me and now my friend here we were our own little support group I think there was 5 of us in the beginning we have potluck and we go to different communities meet with survivors and then residential school process everything started happening and what we tried to do was kind of update everybody on what was happening until it's brought me here and now that's why I said I still haven't gotten around to my IEP yet one of these days I guess that'll happen I've been in it with the door Bernard new beginning in 1995 when we started 95 oh my God like quite a while now I'm 15 years like that and still so haven't had a hearing in the beginning like I said before this I didn't expect compensation but I want people to know what the stories stars that wouldn't happen to children to the families to the people in their communities and I said sometimes when I talk I don't really have to talk too much further than my family we have everything in my family we had a lot of a lot of sickness whatever a lot of sadness like you and I said to him when you have a large family of 13 or 9 when presidential School you come back and you're really affect the community big time I have one of the workers say the color should be whackers when we come back please come back Miss beat up on people as that was the only thing we learned was out of sight and how to defend yourself and I thought that racing it is it was another way to fight and I was to help people to try and help others and I said I see all of the things that are happening still today in the community not the alcohol the drug the abuse it happening Family Services still taking children a lot of abuse still happening sometimes it gets discouraging and what are you do who helps where you go but I see so I can't give up and I like a lot of the other those of us that are still here today I was told one time that we're not survivors anymore we've become Messengers we need

46,1,1,2 minutes the afternoon or good evening it so I'm falling asleep here I'm really tired cuz I was like A3 hour difference so remember I come from its like 8:30 my time now my name is Lonnie Johnson I come from Mom eskasoni Cape Breton Nova Scotia and that there is some at the other end Cape Breton I was in residential school when I was nine came out when I was 15 I was out for a couple years between age 13 and 14 and what my mother just didn't know what the time when she signed us in because some of the older ones had gone it was that the once you sign in your children you sign over all your relinquish All rights parental rights to your children so when we came home for the summer we stayed home for two years so I guess they were missing us so the priest and now I'm one of the other ones came back in June and told my mother that the rest that myself and my sister I'm a other two brothers me on your sister would be going with me going back against Denver I'm a mother I think always maybe he felt bad about this but never really am talked about it we talked about it and we so upset her and we never knew why and I think going to sense we used to be kind of mad at her or upset that we figured that she was getting rid of and it was not tell them we had a conference in our community that the percent to their ass too how many of us went to the school it was nine of us my family that went to the residential school in the ass me is your mother still alive as if he has a cyst you think she'd want to come in now I'll ask her so she came in after dinner and now I never talked and he asked if he was mrs. Johnson why did so many of your children go to the residential school and I guess nobody ever really asked you that before but what she told them was that the Indian agency RCMP in the when they came to the house they told her that too many children it was 13 of us and at the time my mother had cousins that had tuberculosis and her children were with water it was for other children besides us and I think that was like 17 of us at home at that time so they took the younger ones everybody of school-age they told her that if we didn't send the children to the residential school that she would lose her rash back then I guess traction was flower tea molasses sugar send me a few other things so we I never could understand why is it because we had Gardens we had chickens we had a guy I thought we were pretty well-off you know we didn't have running water and everything but I don't remember anybody being hungry or anybody being colder dirty I thought we were all right and the residential school a lot different than what I thought would be at first it seemed like a great adventure we're going on this train right now you know just turned green anyway but we got there in the first night that was like you get into recreational nothing maybe the size of this room and what you had to do was take your clothes off it in the shower come out and then you were delayed and you got new clothes and and you got a number the number that I remember was 47 and I became 47 over 47 was before me I think I inherited everything that went with number 47 and that was mental physical sexual abuse Tobit and this went on until I was 5th like 15 maybe 14 1500 back the second time I'd like the residential school taught me was to survive I guess to be angry I hate a lot of people I ended up hating myself and I never realized all of this at the time but it wasn't until years later when I had left I became alcoholic I lost my children that and then they returned home 18 years later I came back to the community and now I wanted to fit in so I joined this prayer group and I became a cold for the church I done reading site on the whole bit annum and it that went on until late I think one night and 90 something when they both would have written a book on them out of the dips before that I was a reader in church and I remember reading that one night it was a Wednesday night and then the first reading was ever start of the dips and when I seen that I couldn't I couldn't move I couldn't say nothing and it seemed like maybe 5 or 10 minutes to me but was probably five seconds I don't know but I read the reading and I told a priest I won't read again and Isis if you asked me to read again I won't be back so the next week I was on the bulletin and I just didn't come back and it wasn't until Isabella but her book came out that I think was at the summer that that she helped me when I left at school I had nightmares for 39 years and it was with her help and now you want to talk and circle with her Factor that helped me and I at the time that the nightmares stopped I don't have them today thank god well I have occasional funny ones but the not exactly nightmares and type things and for that I seem to think I was all right again and then I was asked again you know that you think about residential school bus group coming in from the Archdiocese of a teenager paper and I said oh yeah yeah sure I can do that and we got there and we're in a circle like this and I don't throw myself on my goodness I hope there's no priests or nuns here I got scared and when it came my turn I said holy I just good evening I'm number 47 and I cried and I cried I cried for two days and was like I couldn't stop crying every time I would stop or wake up I would cry again so that's when I figured like number 47 had better start healing so wherever there was healing rooms river that was healing taken place that's where I would go and it was like you are tornadoes people and for me that's where I found you and for myself I know it's hard here for a lot of people to come in this week and even like now it sometimes it gets emotional it seems like everytime I come to these conferences I hear more but each time people are beginning to get a little bit better there's a little less pain is a little less hurt and I find out for myself to a beginning to a it doesn't seem to matter as much what matters now is the children our children our grandchildren n I'm hoping that by this and educating our people and the people out there people like me on this will begin to heal nothing starts with yourself your family your neighbors even Chief and Council people around you and I've always learn to I think maybe reconciliation I can pretty well understand it and it was one of the gifts that my mother left me asset never to be angry at a person no matter what they did and at 4 it took me a long time to understand that and in my heel and I have to see it that way as well I couldn't hold old church the whole non-native community is to blame but I did hold the people responsible of certain individuals to me these are the people that did it and it wasn't everybody else because I know a lot of times we all somehow get misjudged her mrs. Appleton Olive actor it's a real honor to be here with everybody today and I'm grateful I never thought that we would actually sit here today and all and no from the time we begin and when we first I think Matt Med was Matthew Cohn come all I wanted was for people to know people to know the story of these schools and to know what happened to the Joker and I used to talk to the in different schools but it was always about the children native non-native all children interview find poverty or people but have problems you find a lot of abuse and so that was just what's the children act as part of today I just wanted to thank everybody for the opportunity I didn't mean to speak I told my story quite a few times I have many stories but that's another day I just want to thank you,92.59,20.22,1.48,76.92,0.010514019

art therapy I help my late Brother Gary he died of AIDS like about four years ago and yesterday's really angry at me because um they had a scroll up here it was from Gordon's residential school and they had a name of my brother's pent-up perpetrator and I was telling the people they're not standing or no really upset and I said well what's the health people drink like you know sure this is a good thing to reunite residential people but why have a pedifilers name up on the scroll it's like praising him and I was really upset and I said my brother died because of him raping him and my brother told me lots of things what happened to him and I was so angry and upset you know and I wouldn't told those people I said you guys talked to take that down it said you know I'm glad I'm not I'm glad I'm not a violent person I thought I would have ripped that thing down like that was what really stood me up inside Lake Tahoe my family we've since my mom and dad died and they do too like we've come a long way here in our healing Journey like we have holes we will help please my Leapster passed away and she left 5 children she told me lots of things when she was in residential school how much she she grew hate inside of her you know she grew hate inside of her and she didn't want to have nothing to do with my family because that's what the supervisors done for her and I liked it we can talk to one another you know and she hated me she died like that and you know I'm really sad my sister she didn't have a chance should have a chance to help you come up with her issues she died with a broken heart her son died a couple of months ago from drinking and driving in those are the kind of effects that the government done to us and my own children like I'm open with them I told him what happened to me in residential school and I'm now when I type in I don't really share them how do I share with them what happened to me in school but I just help people like my Prof asked me why am I why am I getting into education and I said it because I went native kids to feel happy I don't want I want them to have a native figure to make them feel happy to me like I had a hard time forgiving my people to question a white teachers they really they really scarred me and my family I know I just wanted to know I just want to let people know that you know healing is it takes it takes a lot of it's a never-ending Elm Road answer me like when I was young I was 15 years old and when I want to take my life by my mom was alive then and she talked to me she had a good talk with me and I think it's my mom didn't talk to me I would have just ended my life you know I would have just took my own life and said okay that's it you know how to take my cold this and break it when I had my children hand all I want is the government to to 2 hour make more actions make more I'm making more aware that I don't think like them I know when we have these meetings like after cyan and all of that like there needs to be more done like yesterday I told my cousin said you don't burn the social workers you know where are the Chiefs in our leaders you know they're nowhere to be seen you know I said I'm opening up my wind here and there's resources in a city like I live here and talk to me but I feel sorry for the ones that have to go back the reserve in Oprah's there's really nothing for them you know there's the go back to 2 wondering where else what else should I do you know cuz I remember and I was denied both how to um I had to really dig deep and my issues I didn't know how much the pain with it affected my health and I wouldn't down my doctor told me if I didn't know if I was going to come over with my pain I was like I'd I had a cancer growth growing in me and I'd it was from Pain you know when I didn't know we have to deal with it. Too to imply and I didn't know how to cry because that's what residential put on me they taught us how to how to be an emotionless you know how to be a robot and I'm really glad like I just want to thank for my brother and my niece that are here with me um we've come a long way has a family like I said leave some we found we talk when we we take care of our needs to turn our our nephews now but yet the pain is still there it's still it's still love it's still really am the plecostomus car you know even though I'm I'm heading my fifties now I'm still angry and fine I'm I don't know if I'll ever forgive you know peoples debt forgiveness to this thing but I don't think it is you know it's just something that happens in your life and it's it's really hard to swallow no but I'm thing I thank God that I have my kids you know when I'm open with them and I just do my best and I just I just hope that dumb someday that I can forgive but it's just like I'm a big roll Roblox for me you know a shelter myself like I just go to school and come home I don't really not that I am unfriendly or anything like that it's just I just don't want to meet new people and have them hurt me and I did it it's really um my emotions are like really sensitive you know but in doing so I just wanted to let you know that I am thankful for being here today and I'm really glad that the donut play cuz if my brothers would have thought that likely would have been really really angry home I have some when I saw that play got you I got really angry and I just thought of my brother automatically and I'm so happy that time I'm so happy that died but he wasn't here to see if he would have really really upset over it I spoke my sister this morning and I told her I was coming into the healing the ceiling 3: she just told me that speak for my heart and let things out I'm an artist tune Hydro picture of my granddaughter I was holding her and I wrote a little poem to her house Loretta robotic University in the phone and really emotional I was holding her and I told her I was writing a story to her and I told her I said I'm so glad my granddaughter that you don't have that when you look out the window you don't eat your brick building or you don't need to wake up enough to beat the see if you can watch TV you can watch cartoons all day and I told my granddaughter or not poem I said you don't know if you don't have to be labeled anymore you could be called by your name you don't have to have a number 5 for number 10 or 15 and 12 like what I done I had and I told my granddaughter that you're free to dance and sing talk in your language I said a lot of things in my poem that are really emotional but I dedicated that my my granddaughter the seventh generation and we are the ones that broke the ice and my kids are the ones through more less like putting High keep telling my kids are you guys up to help Mom put her cookies together and I'm really glad that I have them because you know we would sit around and we have a good cry and Weiner talks and if it wasn't for them I like them they keep me going I'm going to discontinue my healing process I am I pray a lot of my time and there was a point where I just didn't want to I just hate a church so much I just hate it with a passion piano my brother died like I didn't want him to go into the church there are the ones done damage to him I have so much hurt against the church in then I'm so much wrong with my family pretty much the story solo when my brother died like we're having a three-day funeral for him like funeral how to body the name 20 minutes good riddance team that I can get to know me and we didn't even see his body that's what really hurts me when I buried my brother today I told my kids with I'm going to start doing something with my pain 2005 East all these years like I was chasing my pain try to find answers and people want my kids to make me happy they make me happy when I knew my payments like I really really have to do something with it I can't do it on my own so many good start going back to my soul to the sweats with long it's the only way I'm going to heal I'm so glad my sister's now we're at the age where were opening up like we're not ashamed to tell one another what how we are abused and residential school and I'm glad because we have that trust with one another Medford my late mom taught us to listen to one another not to repeat things we tell one another and I'm so happy that time like I said but I'm glad my mom wasn't here to see all this pain that her kids have it happened to them from residential school I told my sister this morning we're talking and I said to her you know she said don't worry Brandon anytime I'm going to get my money and I told her you know

let her live with her kids don't think back to my residential friends when we were kids remember me my friend Christina Charles and grade five Lutheran grade 2 she left residential school she nearly froze to death but came back for residential school nurse so happy to see you and now all she could say is the only thing of Frozen is my hand and now we're just happy cuz we are a family and we are sisters and we still are despite of what I went through and residents going I'm really glad I'm still friends with my friends I grew up with they treat my kids like their own and nitrate their kids like my own and how much playing all of every day was withheld residential school but just the incident that happened is really hard for me to to come out and and I'm talk about it you know I just

48,1,1,green light's not on yet but my introduction would even take 20 minutes I'm talking fast and we my name is Margaret I am I'm crazy up and I'm from the water Hidden Lake First Nation I've been in 4 different residential schools for nine years every first one I was that was Blue Bell student residence up north then I went to the breath or three years grades one two three great for I did it st. Anthony's in Union Lake and five six seven eight I didn't say Michaels in Duck Lake I have lots of negative memories of our boarding school but also have good memories good and it was bad to the school and I am and I do know there comes a point in time when somebody says we got to heal and we are survivors and we can't be victims anymore but that is a journey it is a journey that you have to take and it takes a lot of courage I am I have really you know I had um I came from a family where we were very isolated our community lot of trees were Hunters gathers were people who'll and very hard-working people very good people but I was also a I am a social worker I had agreed social worker and I was working towards a event she won work towards a master's in sociology I really took to Sociology university cuz he's really that's where I really started an understanding about what happens about you know the residential schools being a tool of the colonizers and you know of and then it may be made me understand better just how the church affected not just the First Nations people but every every continent they were in every country they conquered there's a very similar history and and I'm iced up my am and I can tell people like all the boarding schools I went to I made a lot of friends that maybe I would never have known I met students from all over the place people who spoke different languages that I would never have known had I not gone there you know but also on the other hand when I was going to school it was what I was in university that I really understood just how we were form they wanted to you know or must you know they wanted to Fort before must Indian people into these into white Society say we never could so will you were trying to begin yet but we are also being raised by white people and to be functional in the world and you know it and I must say there's people on my travels like when I was in school there was it was the good nuns it was the good priest there's also the bad priests and a bad month they were there I remember this one this one yet none when I was an onion Lake should we leave took to me just to make me help her you know she teach me skill shoes to take me to the kitchen and she's to talk to me she must sense that you know I needed someone there she was really good and I remember if you still have she thought the other nuns were treating me bad she would go give these other and then she would take off for me you know but I seen a kind of this lady that that really helped me through the rough times and I remember when I was in boarding school in labret boarding school we also had this white lady who'd come work at the school she did seem stressed but she she was such a kind soul I mean I really thought the people that helped us survive shit such a kind soul always had it you know she always had a good thing to say you had such a grouch yet such a gram motherly Instinct about her and I always your mother I always think of this lady and she's probably long gone into the spirit world but I remember the very first residential school I went to was probably the worst it was it was Blue Bell it's just north of where I live in 4 years I could never think of this place without their just meeting a really dark cloud and you're such a really dark building probably where I experienced some of the worst in the first time I was separated from my mother you know and being bullied by other students some of the worst treatments I got it work from just the other residents that were there and it took me a long time to find out these people were lonely they were they were miserable they were not happy and that's why you don't they were bowling and doing other things and name-calling that's some of the worst name calling I've ever experienced was in the boarding school and that first year I got every sickness a man is about man and I got Mom I got chicken pox I got the flu and I got ear infections that I got sick about every every sickness imaginable but up in the things that stay in my mind is just we never got I never got proper care you know maybe give you aspirin and never went to the doctor you just stayed in the dorm I bought you soup wants them all and those you've really really tough times when I was that young and it was until so I went to doctor a car that was I was great five six seven eight and we were integrated into the Town School of Duck Lake so we got so we go to school with a lot of them went to the town school with a lot of white students and so we did have access to people and we went to school with a lot of people from the reserve beardies and I still have many good friends from those days a lot of good friendships that I made an experienced a lot of kindness when when I wasn't exactly in st.michaels that was when it was less and less control from the church it was more Indian involvement like Saskatoon Tribal Council took over school and so you have more reading and staff so I got to see the positive man I was in that Lake we had very good that we had very good school programs we had very good sports programs and I've seen a lot of really good soccer teams for kids to play soccer that's coming from that's cool but not only that I was upgraded and we had a I like I said Lord leads we played in Sports Forum and when I left that's why I went to metal like I went to a white school and they were really impressed in that school they were really impressed with how I could play store not so I either school you know what that positive thing heads up I know there's times that I never really I told my start my daughters here with me to ask her to come and I've told her pieces of my story I've never told her completely everything my parents were products of the Indian residential school and that they race that sometimes in a very strict way it was very rigid sometimes it seems really hard sometimes really we didn't get that loving that I thought we should get you know but saying that to you know I see now the harshness our communities lived in times were hard you had to work you had to chop what you had to hunt you had to do things to survive and you need to learn those skills to survive and I it wasn't till you know I started some of that healing was until I was in is finishing high school that I did I recognize that I had a rage which region side door is my mother because you know in my own distorted way I am I really felt she was just possible for me being in school and her not being there all those years I thought you was responsible and the I could not believe that bridge it was so deep inside you're taking me a long time long time to get to ever in my mind I was until I started you know some therapy and somebody told me you know what your mom was a product of residential schools your mom cannot give you what she doesn't have to give you your mom doesn't have it you know your mom has her own issues she never heal then as and as a child you had parents for not healed they were not well and not parent it took me to one long time to understand that you know and also as I got older I began to understand when I was born I can the late fifties when I was that was when our children now you know had couple Generations had been going to boarding school our communities were changing it was westward expansion there was a lot of things coming in you know and that in itself just upset societies and it was in the fifties that alcohol was allowed in our communities in the reserves and to me that some of the most damage not just a boarding school but when alcohol was allowed I was a little girl when I seen stuff we're now we would have been apprehended if there was agencies around all the adults were drunk all kids week we were left out in the perpetrators were left open to anybody we were in trouble alternates were drunk you know and I still carry this Dimension my mind me and my cousin are the same age and he's in the spirit world now but women most secure sold and all the old people all the you know the address for passed out in a and he was six years old and he had to go feed the horses now you're still member that six years old he had a responsible going to get his horses and make sure they're watered like you member hit and looking so small taking those horses butt I remember how you just you had to learn to survive you know and I was also as I got older I began to see some stuff even their communities how are communities became very talkative very very toxic and they still are you know I worked in my community for when I went back I went to back to my community for about 15 years I work there and that was some of the worst experience if I had you done being a month working with my own people like you still see people being so needy just the lateral violence you know things we say to each other the way we treat each other in our communities MSU where comes from not going to blame the truth cuz you can but it comes from a distraction just the destruction of the family systems how we live how we grow up and how we treat each other but also Ohio I am excited my account in our community I seen a couple situations where we get new leadership be no people are in there at one point in time they fired both 6 people and this caused a lot of ruckus in our community and I've never seen and I was the time the residential school money came into our communities we start getting lots of money and I'm never seen such greed in my community Houston people you don't they have used the money that was supposed to go to survivors I seen I almost could see the priest in the nuns walking around in our communities I almost could you noticed just telling you these people how to behave you know but anyways it was a really rough time in my community it was very toxic and then I eventually had to leave my community and I'm I do shop protection I work in Alberta for the MHL Britain for the last 9 years I'm on a break right now but time you can see the family systems you know you could to see write down in the family you get to see you we have a long way to go and it still hurts me because I still see your children being lost to a similar system like the child welfare system and you know I work right in the system we're good minion people it is a good system but it's also one of the hardest things to get your children back from one system to get them out of the system and bringing home to their families and dab I don't know I had a lot of stuff prepared and Sunday I'm blank maybe I'm just try to lie or something it's a joke and I will tell I did go through the IEP process I remember one time I was leaving I was working for Star season 2 start of Calgary and up I wish I stopped and hobbema you know I'm stopping at stores in this guy give me some information about the IEP process so I get to Calgary and I called I called block and Associates so that at that time and that someone's ones there within a week take my statement it was really rough it was rough for me to do my statement I give a hot room I had to remember I had to go you know I had to remember the abuse that happened to me in boarding school and all the abuse probably took took place that first year when I was there when I was a student I suffered abuse at the hands of a priest while he was giving us catechism lessons and I have to really really relieved that and tell my story you know with the process and I remember them just that afternoon after you know I did my intake I got to stick my leg swelled up really bad really swelled up yeah and I took a while it took a while for you know the swelling to go down had to go see the doctor but I'm who did take away I think was about I didn't mind you know my intake is go to you 2 years later that I went in front of the you know I went to the IEP hearing but I was living and working up in Fort McMurray then and I and I need to tell you people if you're going to go through AARP process you have to have all your information as accurate as possible remember the days remember the times and has awful that it is I had to talk about the abuse at the hands of the priest during catechism lessons and and I remember the church the way she started crying listen to my story I think she seen seven year old girl you know how you go to school people who supposed to take care of you how they emotionally damaged you know the use religion they damage you in one of their over a man abuses you Edmond that was that was the sexual abuse but you know suffering I'm suffering abuse at the hands of nuns later that was in it sounds like you know it's almost like they just pound you and pound you and pound you tell me are you and I think that's why the commission lawyer was just crying she's crying and she said he know I heard so many stories she said if I hear so many stories not because I hear the worst she said it he said it hurt I guess it just hurts just as much but it didn't take me long to get my money I mean I got the first level of this is kind of funny when I look at it you know if you do well you know if you do really well with your life you go on you no longer on your you're no longer a victim you get less money but I did get level 1 but as you know I went to HighSchool I did fairly well I am didn't have any major major addictions I went to University and I held good paying jobs in RI but I still did get a settlement time it was only about 7 months later my process went fast but the priest who abused me was probably had the most victims of any of the rest of the schools in Canada he was there she was charged as pedophile like he had put if your charges on him so that made the process easier but just let you people know if you can remember the dates you can remember the times as much information process is faster it's easier and you know this is a tough process like all the healing it doesn't it doesn't happen all at once bits and pieces when I started admitting would really happen to you you know and there are like I also have good stories to tell if it's an outside but I remember the time just before my. The lawyer calls me you know and she said you have to talk about the abuse and such a really good details that you have to be able to but anyways I'll just tell this one last story and I had been in the park and I talked to her for a long time I had to been walking in the park that I go stomping home I was so mad because I relieving some of the abuse and then I went stomping home and I was just mad I was sending these white guys in the truck for calling me hey hey and I was thinking perverted was there was he said there is a bear running around be careful,66.49,30.19,2.97,51.25,0.010771993
49,1,1,Crystal Miami Dakota send one from care of the cattle it's good to be here and thank you for allowing me to be here and for your words why I went to residential school in and now lebreton Maryville when they first started having actually went when the apology first happened I went I went to go on my dad my relatives because I they are to leave the sauna service what's up with a broken spirit and yes that does affect me because I'm timer my journey is mainly been intergenerational trauma that I've faced my place today where you know you have her tonight so it was going to hurt you feeling is everything and I'm understanding that deeper everyday I come from a place that's was broke my circle was broken it was interrupted I want to say it's broken it was interrupted in my eye I can't speak for my siblings on my family and I don't have that right too so I need to be kind of General about some things here and you know I come from incest and it took me years and years and years to even say the word it took me years nearest nearest even understand that word I'm still trying to understand it but most importantly in my journey today I I believe in healing why do for myself know that and believe that everything that happened in my my life and my passes is for reasons and again I'm beginning to understand something them even know it's really really painful two part of my healing I do today is as I write I'm alright tonight and I spend time with my family on I have many rules in my life I'm I'm a mom I'm a grandmother I'm at you started being I'm a helper I'm a teacher and I on a roll of those rolls today and I'm so grateful. That I'm able to find that and myself and I look forward to you know each day I'm giving kind of ironic and what I've heard at the from many people that I have to go into a system of Education today that to learn my history and when I first learnt my history especially residential school because my dad didn't talk about it and before he left this world he he started talking very little about its hands shortly you don't want it so what I want to she wanted to back to visitation systems to go work on my degree I began to learn more about the residential school then because it was started to come up more and for friends him and like I say it was quite ironic that we have to go back to that education system Western World take to learn this but in spite of that I'm grateful it was really angry for a long time in my life and when I have to relearn this I was even more angry and I didn't know who to be angry there was so many people I find it amazing I was able to finish my degree because I'm so angry when I began to really understand the impact and the intergenerational impacts of residential school because many of us you know we still see if we live in it and it's really important to keep learning about it though to listen to the people the ones who went before us and the ones sorry to generational survivors it's so important to honor the words I want to listen to the older people like I saw one other words and I'm so grateful that they're breathing and that they share their pain because it is healing and they give me hope and I'll come to you do these kind of gatherings because I come like I said to all tomorrow my dad my relatives who suffered so much sure but we're never able to heal I icon for myself I come from my children and my grandchildren to continue healing and breaking the Cycles in my family and it's not easy but it's something that I believe with all my being that it's it's also guess that's within a stain on my white paint as his sub also been my healing and it will continue to be I've been really emotional last few days because I always feel my helpers with me I always feel my well with his with me cuz I pray for them especially when events like this happen I come from my brothers as well because I have older brothers that so are still really suffering the effects of of our life and it's been very difficult for them I know a large part of it is how we as a society continue to tell her man that it's okay to cry it is okay to cry am I under the Menace but she would come to her to heal because you get me home because I suffer with frustration and anger that that's so my family still suffering I have a brother who's very close to me and he ran from our pain and never came back and we haven't seen him for over 20 years and he's like he's like my soulmate so why I pray for you everyday he's still out of service but you know it's not paying this is not breed that Robin has been I think that you know whenever I'm around circles and ceremonies in Linda the work I do is so so social workers well it's It's Been Working Families it's them again against me hope because I do believe in healing I believe that like I said I believe my everything that I've experienced was was meant to be even if it's things that are very you know shameful and painful I've learnt to to understand myself have learned to love myself and I'm grateful I know for me might might might might just if that's what you want to call it is it's my healing that's my money for me anything else it's about healing it's about continuing to heal my circle my family Circle it's about continuing to men not only my spirit but for the sake of my children and grandchildren I am I have ensured a lot with my son's I have my sons are on their own now and and I haven't really shared a lot with him because I've always felt that I wanted to wait till they were a little bit more mature in life and it's definitely not because I've been the perfect parent but I would my children were small I always remember the day that 1o School drinking I have come home and my one sister who's babysitting his hold me my son was a window crying for me really painful to hear but I'm grateful to this stage with all this because I gave me flashbacks as well because I remember those kind of days been home for days for months with my siblings and no adults around and being raised in alcohol and you don't like my sister here says being open till at predators hardest part of that was lot of his family and that's really scary what ever happened to me I I guess it was meant for me because I remember that might baking my help just help you get sober because of scared and scared me too know that I can take my kids to that seems like home you scared me so that begin my journey at that time I'm from letting go of lot of things and one of them was my my using and I'm grateful to this day that scared me so I began to really at that time I began to really take a look at that myself I love my children so much for that I was willing to do anything to come out of the cycles and today I'm grateful I'm so grateful helpers it took me awhile to get clean it to me a few years but I did it Andover Maine clean Sensen I'm grateful for them it's time to keep speaking out it's time to stop being silent about the trauma that we all share and that's why I'm okay I had my reservations about sitting here in front of a camera but it doesn't matter where we sit in the circle when you share your healing and you share your truth it doesn't matter where it is because I believe the helpers are always with us the blessing for me and being part of something like this is like I had shared earlier than when they first had this so I did go to honor my dad and my uncles and aunties because I have seen the trauma the residential school when my dad before my dad left my mom had a cyst to go sit with him in the hospital we didn't want to really difficult thing to do because all still really angry but you know what we were blessed to have a kind loving mom she didn't go to residential school funny she tells me a story that she wanted to so she can be there friends remember thinking thank goodness she never went my dad went and saw we suffer those effects videos of angers me because we have to pay the price we didn't but I work today I don't question lot of things that I do have a lot of faith in like I said I simply just keep doing what I need to do that here and part of that healing for me is is speaking out not because I know that when it comes to that word incest is still a lot of time there so I message it all shares for me what I've learned is that's where the shame stays silent it don't matter if you come to the circle and share and whatever way you choose to heal whether it's from ceremony or through church it doesn't matter you need to find a way to heal and when I was growing up in a different city with my brother and I run away from foster home and we ended up living on the streets for six years and we congregated with a lot of the I don't know how I would say that I guess you know with all the people that were in the streets and and assoc the people that were gay that sticks in my mind all the time because the more I learn about him the more I learn about II swear to beings as well and they have their own them so I'm just going to generalize I thought they have their own specific names many of them are gone now but some again that was meant to be even though it was a really painful time to be connected and be together and it saddens my heart that because of this interference over teachings many of our people have lost that respect for the to spread of people and that's another thing that I'm in so much pain about but I guess I believe you know that time will come on it's my turn off and that we find our way home again to who we are and our tree spirits and in our purpose and meaning so I created them all the time all those helpers that are out there and in the spirit world my relationship that I have with greater and my helper is it that I understand is what keeps me healing absolutely that's what keeps me healing in closing I am I love you all thank you for being here and I I encourage that we continue to heal and honor and love one another in a good way because love is the only thing that's going to help us heal,80.67,27.81,3.37,92.42,0.003755869
50,1,1,my name's Anna ponies and I come from sap give me Reserve I was in Maryville boarding school I believe I was in a lot more than the maravel I was I was also raised in the foster home system so

they have made me a granny I'm going to have 4:10 babies pretty quick and that my little grandson in my little granddaughters there their they're the ones that can change it every time I feel like messing up and everything I think I have to keep thinking of my daughter I have to keep thinking of my granddaughter I've taken there's many times I've tried to commit suicide because I got so tired of trying to commit suicide so I decided to take a suicide intervention course to figure out what is going on why am I thinking like so and for a while I thought I was crazy because when you're a little girl and you get bumped on the head with a ruler for even saying boo and that you feel the blood pouring down your face and all they do is sit there and they don't do anything to you think just throw you out into the bed again don't come I remember trying to go cry to my sister and my brothers but I believe in Merivale they had boys like older and younger people and older group of people that we couldn't mix but I remember my brothers and sisters going on that school bus and I'm staying there at the center I don't know how I got there I don't know if my mother drop me off or I don't know if those guys come and pick this up but I remember being there I remember my my little buddy Lana her and I were always so close I was talking to her and all of a sudden we both Club beat up she got one somewhere I don't know what happened to her but I had to go to the church and watch the pews with the toothbrushes I remember how the church I remember how the boarding school said I remember watching those children play on that merry-go-round in trying to go play with them tried to go play with them play with them they want you over here I remember some days we were the beat hungry so we would run away then we get beat up we could found in the bushes again from trying to run away get back set an alarm at Maryvale you go over there they have that cattle Bridge before they have that new rope they used to always cross that title but they told us if we cross that kettlebridge that we were going to fall and then we're young some nights will be sleeping and all I remember is his long black gown and I believe I caught the last of the nuns I could probably 73/74 if I remember that locked out and those white shorts when she lifted up her dress what are the best things my papa has ever done with come and steal me in the middle of night I remember him tell me I remember him yelling I remember Crossing that bridge in your great big green station wagon it looks like he filled up the car with his kids in his station wagon took it away from there and I was telling him what was happening in heat I remember he got really drunk when he said in his time why he quit school at 3-3 is because back then they still have to go cut wood and stuff like that and he did he was too he was fooling around and he said that priests beat him up with a bullwhip English my girl I'm sorry that's all I remember say yes I'm sorry but I always remember that you that little Merry Go Round my dad took it away from there remove to the city and I believe in the seventies at that time he leads to say that they had to ask permission to leave any and I don't I don't I don't know what to think of that which he used to say that he goes he goes you're not going to be you're going to be able to walk off that reserved you're not going to sit there and ask for permission to leave because we had to ask permission and all of a sudden my mom she took his back from the city back to the reserve and next thing you know we're under school bus and I remember I had to stay there overnight or something cuz I remember them picking us up after little bad taking that my lad and putting paws on our heads making us lay on the bed but no nothing on putting up hello there that way I was and that hurts but I remember wouldn't have to go back I said I would didn't I remember being there for a little while overnight and going back under school bus going under school bus that late there was no more lunch lady unit was not there so happy but there was a guy there does heat cause bladder or Kathy or she'll I would be talking your soda we were told not to I remember we had like nice hair and next thing you know it little square boys use to call each other script because they are you still for a little treat that little square box that you that have hipster haircut go to Justin remember when we could have a talk and I like still like I I'm not going to stop talking I don't care if I sound like it Intermatic Queen I don't care as long as I get it the other school that was out at the Wasco home that father Larry guy I remember he had one fat leg and when I mean wouldn't you wouldn't use to get beatings used to take us to other houses and sell it to some big guy by the name of Santa Santa bills and he give us money makers movie stars take pictures of us think that we're all high-and-mighty but I think Regina it drives me because of all the other homes that I was in all the crap that I've lived in my whole entire life from the time I was probably 6 years old and it just ended four months ago and I'm sorry if I'm going to be jumping all over what I think about father Larry that none that woman are you still always trying to hide under beds in closet just so nobody would find me cuz that's a nightmare getting woke up in the middle of night go but that's what father Larry I always want I'm always searching looking for my pictures I was just a baby when he took those pictures not even sure if those nuns Linda mariveles has taken pictures but I remember pictures I have trouble going to my Reserve because that's cool is not there no more but the houses there's a new houses there can you imagine that was one of the worst things that they could have done is put houses that I should just I could that whole piece of land out of there because of what taking my language taken taking my life now I'm at a very crucial stage in my life? And I have trouble sitting in a classroom if I hear a loud voice I can't very intimidated why get intimidated is crazy when you hear that woman rating in your face you think everybody is the same sometimes when you hear voices I can draw you the whole scene Outback residential school I could probably draw the women's faces because sometimes I've been fighting I've been fighting with addictions all my life I remember when I went to I think I was like 16 years old I went to Pine Grove for like 45 days bean and pod girl in the dorm reminded me of the residential school I didn't go back to Pine Grove I became an isolator in my own home today I have a very hard time trusting or believing in anyone why because all started when I was like five six years old then the system Bender street life streetlife came to dry drunk I think I think if you're going to be a dry drunk before I just get drunk could a dry drunk is worse than being a drunk but I'm here today because I want to help I want to help these people I want I'm going to go back to the street that's all I know if the street like the foster home life that is where I'm going back as a health worker I will sit on a street corner in the back alley watch my buddies do their effect and drink why cuz when I needed somebody when I tried to OD there's nobody there and all they need is somebody to sit there and talk with them they don't need somebody to sit there and judge them just because they are just the wrong way I watch it every one I look at all these people that were once in the same place as ours I watch some that's been there and now they turn their faces on where they came from you cannot deny where you come from all you could do this Make Yourself Strong make yourself stand so you can grab your sister your brother's hand and go walking into hey it's okay it's okay to shut it dear it's okay to be like that but we know once you start showing them the love the compassion they'll change their hearts because then they'll start to believe in themselves when you get told not to talk you lose the inside of you you talk you could told you're a liar why because they don't want to sit there and hear hear what you have to say just another way for them to cover their butts I got to crunch because you what if I'm not crunching and I'm scratching so I rather be crunching oh you got time I guess my time is ready I've got so much I need to say so much I want to say I don't care about money I don't care about anything I just all I care about is helping me get a healthy so I can go and help those other people get healthy walk with me until I'm able to walk on my own people don't forget where you come from don't look down on your buddies next to you you see somebody hungry either get some something to eat you are so sweet those people there on the street they're asking for change don't get them to change get them food because why you're just helping them to kill himself talk about all the residential schools I've been in every one of them it was bad like I did hook up with a guy that was from the residential school I hit lived his pain I know what just before you how to keep flapping flapping in Flatbush,88.75,17.45,13.8,72.57,0.006825939

When I went got picked up at school as a little boy not much older than my grandson this is the third generation now and Maya support life sober life straight life my son and then this one and he's got up he's on one of the reasons that I'm still sitting here actually today about 4 or 4 years ago I start thinking about suicide more so than any time and I was invited to northern BC All Nations Gathering to do someone's out there for them to show them our culture in the Prairie Provinces and now he was born while I was up there and for some reason I came alive out there again and I wanted to get home I couldn't wait to get home I Drove all night and all day to get home she was born and since that time he's been by my side he sleeps with me I change them take care of yourself I'm here baby has the same name as me as me majority I just doesn't enjoy these over the tree and the first time so nothing that I that I have is I have a lot of love for my kids I sure love love I hug them and tell him I love him and I learned that from the reflection of my lifestyle I want to when I got picked up at my Maya my grandma was standing in the doorway just two people uniform came I wanted am I believe it or not really yellow stripe RCMP and I was trying to hang on to her apron she told me told me that they just missed telling her that they would love her up and I'll never see her again so she she could push me pushing me to go teach people and some up from that point on I went on a blackout November bits and pieces along the way I was in school I believe in Blauvelt and then the next I remembered earlier on I was on the truck being carried to our lacrosse but what happened from that point on was the things that all of us know about that the abuses of all the four physical aspects of our medicine will idea physical mental spiritual emotional abusers don't want to know end of the story is that we all felt we all felt all those emotions and I am one of these I noticed when I came home was there was no more hugging there was no more I love you are communities my grandparents my parents lost. One when I laugh when I came back I remembered I used to could hug when I first one where I went to school when I came back there was no more and later on in life I continued my community was in disarray a very bad lifestyle and I watched my uncles and brothers and Hanson all drinking and fighting each other I don't know no more of that I can ship that I love Johnny time to hide anything I was only trying to get into able to share bottle after that bottle of shared it nobody can afford it then they got into a fight or something and it was like that so I end up getting your relationship with Prince George I got your relationship out there how would a girl didn't really know her but then I came back four years later she moved back to do I have a cross that was her home phone I didn't realize it then but I met her dinner again and we got married I don't remember ever saying I love her phone number to tell me if she did but I also don't remember getting married I just know that I was married it was something I guess that I thought would be would make me mature or make you forget something but because the relationship I had with my grandma the way I got pushed away it was in the band issues so I couldn't have any relationship with any any woman go to yahoo.com I am a single parent right now home I mean single grandfather and I took years ago my wife and I split up YouTube communication lack of communication I don't have any anger at her or because I understand where I am today my dad thing was there was no love I end up in the jails for 16 years and now I drool I became a very harsh man in the daytime and then Street and I did things to hurt other people but every time I went to jail on an ER when I had relationship room and I told him and I don't want no visitors I was just being an angry person and you wanted to do my way someone Maya I had a visitor one time my wife can visit and I guess they allowed her to come because she was my wife I didn't put no visiting list but she showed up at the pendant Prince Albert one day night got pissed off I really got angry and or to get out of and no stop. I was a very violent person very abusive and that I should get an extension of my stay and they worked on giving me that extension but I actually when she got out of it black guy after 7 relationships I decided I didn't want Ship Center start is a she started working on myself about 31 years ago and I haven't drank or did drugs since that time but I joined. People of South Dakota to Lakota people I might people never taught me no love never told me no love and my community and never even try to help me and I hear a lot of people talking about hun I do too busy with themselves too busy with their own ways of trying to settle things assault one Maya when I'm when I was in jail the last five years I start working on myself to the reflection of my own life who I was and why I was here while I was doing the things I don't own you and look at myself when I was straight and sober. I was a very good person that I always was nice to people I was even actually nice to myself I bought myself clothes I had myself and when I drink it was you upset and I know I still jump into the garbage bins and ate all of them and I NW or not Burger King and all those things and then you know it was saving my money for things. Bob McCosh at the hell was the drugs and alcohol Amazon I live that lifestyle for long but when I start looking at my own reflection in life in jail I am have nobody to talk to I just had me I just had to take a look at me and I started talking to you the Creator I really had an anger for church I had them for the church I had never got out of the priests and the nuns because of what they did to me and in school while I was there the sexual abuses and I like it said all those things but I'm not going to go there today is going good too you know it is very very sad lifestyle that we have out there and the lack of love that we have no our parents we know that our parents all of us we love our kids or grandchildren and I know the love that but they couldn't showed up to the powers were taken away from them from the dental school in the Durham because my mom what my grandma Rosa your loving she still did things for me in the morning so I like in all she put a blanket outside or what she's doing laundry and make bound I can make to you outside and give it to me in the car and when I came back from the dentist Legend how that no Mark was gone LL. Disappeared in and when I wanted to ask him something or other I didn't have the more answers it seems like they just gave up my dad oh my uncle you don't seem to have given up he wouldn't give the hugs the loves they wouldn't advise us on anything because I can understand you know the government to call. The word appearance the Guardians over communities over your children Amish communities and they lost of government that power when did the Declaration of forcing us to go to schools and forcing us to go to Pacha homes so I understand a little bit of that history now nothing I'm 64 year old man and I live to love that hardships butter today I'm I'm I'm okay I'm a little bit angry at what happened but no use staying angry we got to find Solutions or change things and one of those things is like my grandson and my son and my daughter-in-law I always tell him I love you I love you you know I care about you guys I always try to get some advice and if they don't listen I tried to explain in a different way I haven't touched any alcohol or drugs in the 91 2 years I don't remember something.. I have to do on my own I just by looking at myself but like again I said it earlier. I didn't get no care no I don't care attitude back on my command is no I love you know hugs I moved away from there and got married after that make two years after they're married we had a child with a little girl and now by the time he was two days before her birthday in November she passed away she got six in the morning I'm not in Boston and I remember at the fort down I walked into the hospital she stiffened up in my and I didn't know what to do I just kind of went numb Blackhawk I can talk to my sister just saw this happen she was with me. Remember bits and pieces where I remember taking her from the hospital and changing her myself I would love anybody to touch her I even got the cast of myself a little ball made Boston and made and put her in there and cured her my at my brother-in-law's car I wouldn't let anybody ride with me I carry the body myself and future Charter Xavier Cemetery last remember was I was throwing dirt into her casket in the ground and that was a black holder had for 8 years after that I never knew what happened I never knew where I was or what I was doing preachers on that last day over. Eight year that I lost I don't look up in jail at 28 days I remember seeing all going for my sister I'll tell her to get me a Buckskin jacket cuz I wanna on buckskin jackets I'm just excited and then I'm coming home in 20 days so one of the pastor in the Julia give me a phone my phone and number and I was I was lucky my sister never change your number I didn't realize I was gone for eight years I didn't know I was gone free chairs and now she never asked me nothing she just said what size and I'll make it right away and give me the address so I got the address and now 4 days before I was out. The shirt came in because I wore your shirt that she made really beautiful shirt and now I still have that shirt that was back in 1983 I was the last time I I had I said that my four last five years there that was my last year and now I want home visitor I got out the door of my car when I got your place and this lady came running across the street and she's my husband a message to Nowhere talking then no need to talk and I could look and see what she is talking but I didn't know she was talking to and now this woman came out from the same door and she said rosie come back here I'm talking so this woman can running cause bacteria ask my sister who's that woman she looked at messages to my wife that Blackout episode automatic that time for my daughter's death took me all the way back here and I didn't know I know she's so we get along good today she was back home and everyone back together but I guess what I'm saying there is the love that we had before I went to dental school and those kids things that we lost Rodney the situation with my daughter I want to back out because I believe that I was so traumatized by her death not only by her dad that because I didn't know how to respond I'll always love that one I'm lately your toes last so many years and probably about 19 years I didn't feel any of that because of the teachings of the residents to you know it was always do that you can't do that you can't do this at all and so there's nobody say I love you or show that we love each other so I lost them because of the schools and I was not able to give that to my daughter while she was living with us when she was a baby I knew she was my daughter but that's you know we get the carrier but I don't I never showed that to love the way I do this one here just dissed regeneration and my kids know my kids that I have with the samples and as you've all been cheated quite regularly like babies eyes change every single one of them to carry on them I love them tell my love you and I think that's the best thing that we have is the value we got her some of the money is not everything I'm very poor poor person an nnp realistically like it still got my old Roberts from 30 years ago kinda rip in the back and I wear moccasins but I love being that way the clothes that I wear no I have nothing like that into this Taqueria I buy them second-hand it's not.. I don't want and for them sometime but it's just that that's the way I like living I like being my cell just being me and I don't want to be like everybody else I don't want to be driving a car motor by going to be tutoring in the mix I tell my son does need a mechanic but that's the difference that we have not they have a choice because I have a choice as long as it's a good choice and I support them I love them and I love you all and all I really I really can't feel that we have these and I really can't feel that some of us were not or not what did the young man say here will River still here we're not done you know my language is Cree and I still speak three I thought I thought I thought I even got mad I even to a chargeback at the teachers and the nuns when they try to slap me or hit me with rulers or pointers but not Community loving that I used to have disappeared and I moved out younger I later on in my 7th relationship the seventh Wi-Fi app I had done still had no luck we'll have nobody nobody taught me about sport connection until the Lakota people stood up for me the Lakota people got up one of the elders about up and talk to me and asked me how I was feeling really asked me how I feel and just had his eyes pointed at me and that told me how do you feel tell me you are feeling okay and be honest with me in all and when that happened I use somebody cared I'm not pointing down I start for 1 to put the people that I followed your culture today I hold a ceremony older cultures and and I'm very honored that did give me that opportunity if it wasn't for them I don't know where I'd be my people had that opportunity to teach me the same things and I didn't I got it someplace else but it's not that I don't hate my community I still like you but it's very hard to go back there I can't even take my own teachings back there till 1 except them it's just money glitch thank you I'm at IKEA,96.42,17.18,1.72,71.72,0.005889282

57,0,1,"Hello everybody, my name is Gilbert and I'm a Pelican band member up in Manabilia and I'm a Residential School Survivor. I guess I'll start out as seeing there's a lot of benders here like say, there's one I'll try to say how it's said from beginning to end. I can forgive but I will not forget. That's probably me. But personally really right down dear to my heart it's really hard to say that I will forget. I'll say the experience for me for Residential school is an experience is I got a bad ear. I'm partially deaf and it affected me a lot of my listening and learning and schooling. I just completed my ABE up in Merit and say through the experiences of residnetial school I drunk really heavy so I got in some pretty bad car wrecks. There was one I was me and my friends were able to walk away we had a few little scrapes and bruises but I still got the scar myself. After the accident I was out uncouncious for 2 days and 2 ngihts. The Creator let me be able to walk and tell the stroy is I say, my story is gonna be kind of mixed up here and there pardon me. Say it got be with alcohol so bad another story I'd like to tell you about my experience with alchol. I guess I drank and drank so heavy that I I don't know if I got booted out of the bar orstumbled out of the bar I couldn't tell you this. There's a cardboard box where you put paper toilet paper whatever. It was out outside the hotel there. And it was freezing point outside. 10, 15 below zero and I wasn't totally drunk where I couldn't remember. I must have viewed that it was so cold that I had I must have had very little clothes and a light coat and no winter wear of any kind. SOrt of just dressed casually like the dummer time. So I knew that something had to keep me warm. I rode myself into that cardboard box and the premier hours in the morning and this guy goes like this to the cardboard box and goes hey you how are you doing? And I slowly stumbled out of there and got out of the cardboard box somehow and he said come on let's go pick up a coffee and I didn't want to tell him about my experience out there and the cardboard box and he said come on let's go for cofee and we're talking and he said what about you buddy we ride to nutburts and he said people ride along for the business. I was so ashamed of myself for a guy never been minor or anything coming to rescue me for life maybe a couple more hours and I wouldn't live to tell the story so going back through residential school that's where I noticed where the cause was to be angry all the time. Cause to be say where I everything has to do with anger was me. When I wanted to play sports I had to scream and hollar for the sports I loved were baseball and soccer. I screamed my lungs out to my supurvisor that I wanted to play sports and he didn't listen. I was knealing on my hands and knees crying my eyeballs out didn't listen didn't listen and I still followed him crying and I finally got to play sports. Wasn't a good soccer player wasn't a very good baseball player. When it came to make the RB run, I struck out and when I was supposed to make penalty shot for the winning goal I tripped and fell and there was no retry from there. Anyway like I say going back for the part of the story where I know that I'm not the only one that goes through these elocations where we were at the conference I notice people who come and sit beside me and tell me about their experiences. We sit and talk to each about how were doing. And they tell me things that I probably wouldn't share about myself but them sharing to me it's gonna take me a lot back home to give me strength. Say this morning I had a smudge from a different tribe and they told me that the way they smudge is different from ours. And I told them I understood. I understood about ours and the smudging and the way of teaching and our prayers but like I was going to say before there some Korean people in Merit they want me to join in the Christian organization but I have a lot of say fear and guilt is where I don't really say pray in honesty. I'm able to pray in my own native tongue and I do that everyday. But praying in the church way I sort of hold back a bit. With my experiences in residential school sort of accepting of the catholic religion which I accepted a long time ago I'm kind of backing out of it now. There's PTN tribal trails, that's about the closest religion I can go to. About every sunday I turn on the channel and if they're on the channel I turn on and listen to it. That's about the closest prayer I go to cause their Native. Catholic churches whenever I back away because of fear because of what's been done to me, say, it's a part of my whole story in a nutshell. Thank you for enjoying my sharing of my story. ",84.71,46.21,1.44,79.34,0.003690037

rheumatic fever and they used to have fun tonight my uncle and some of them were younger than myself it's my mom and and her mom we're having children at the same time set alarm but they use the first round in the buggy and them because I was not allowed to be stressed I was supposed to be resting all that I'm not walking or running around so these to push me around the reserve on a buggy and we have this hell up then stop missing please put me on the top and push me down then somebody would be at the other end to catch me and that was me resting so what was he know I had such beautiful times and that it was you know a lot of good things happening at when I was at home but there I know there was one pedophile on a reserve and then he tried to touch me and I went screaming home and because my grandfather was well-respected man in the non RS he went there with other other men and told that man he was not welcome on the reserve anymore he had to leave so he moved on to the states and he never came back so I hope but I hope that he didn't continue his horrible teachings down there but I have the things that happened before I went to residential school but were caused by residential school and they were teaching our I don't know when I went to school and I was wondering why I couldn't go and visit my my cousins they were on the other side of the playing field I was on the girls side they were on the boys side and we weren't allowed to go over and talk to them or play with them or anything and I wondered why you know my mic my first cousins and my second cousins they're all my brothers and I couldn't go and talk to them anymore and I never could figure out why we were so you know separated but I tried to talk to one of my cousins cuz he was walking through the girls side alyssum he had to carry something over it as I was going over and talking to him and you know it just everyday stuff and now he ceases Shirley's girls you're not even supposed to come over and talk to me and I couldn't wait to me it was like a slap in the face to say oh my God I can't even talk to me now we've been playing together and sleeping together in the same bed since we're kids since I was born in here I can't talk to him and I can't even go and look at them or anything was really hurtful enough to be told that I couldn't see him talk to him or anything I'm wondering now that we know speaking of sexual abuse at home Jimmy after a while I started realizing they're in there it was happening all around us and in the school does that mean because they didn't touch me physically that I was not affected by the sexual abuse because it was there it was in in another room and I knew something bad was happening but I wasn't sure what it was so you know it I was sexually abused mentally good because they told me I couldn't talk to my my cousins and I am you knew that they were doing bad things to the girls and the boys in another room and I knew it was happening so you know Define sexual abuse that is that is that a form of or is it too is it not I don't know but it's been such a horrible at Minho it was a horrible experience and them and then not being able to talk about your moon and nobody telling you what it was or when it was going to happen or you know that was something to be ashamed of you know they took that away from me even because you know it's an honor it's it's a real true honor to be a woman and I couldn't do anything about it because I didn't know anything about it didn't teach me how to take care of myself or even tell me why I was bleeding I thought I was dying and you know it was it's just what what did I get from residential school other than your bad feelings and the only good feelings I had words when I was talking to my my cousin she's the one who looked after me she's older than me. these two have them girls in the same room that sit in a corner and these to be giggling in the corner and talking about religion and teaching the young girls how to say prayers and end of a knot in it and then I was wondering where the girls were giggling in the front because the girl with the big girls that were in the corner we're sitting there and they were feeling the group young girls so they were taught how to abused each other and that's go and you know that is another thinking of you you know you know Define sexual abuse you know you see it everyday you know what's happening and then I'm it's just there all the time and the unfortunately end it's just not a good place to be and being told by one of the one of the nuns that you know they're there supposed to be at the holy in all that they've gone through all their training and everything to be such a holy person then they're closer to God than you that's what I that's what I thought anyway and here they're telling me that because I didn't put the Apple in the right place on the on the table that I was stupid and I was not worth being taught any way I can teach you anything so you're not be what you're not worth teaching anyway cuz you're going to be a sloth on the street and the lucky thing I didn't believe her I didn't it didn't sink in here or here Dickinson I've been a success in my community and so I've got to defeat at them they didn't put me down low enough to arm Keep Me Down I survived and I'm I've been a contributing woman in my community I have not set back and let everything push me down I have been strong enough to stand up and be the best mother that I could be because I didn't have any training other than my brothers and sisters but I didn't have that continuous teaching from my parents my grandparents my aunts and uncles because I was taking away from them in the they refused to teach me the language for I went to school because they knew that if I talk my language what up what was going to happen I was going to be slapped around or with the status test stand in the corner and be told that I did something wrong again and um it's just them it's just been continuous Sun beating down beaten down and that's cool but them I must have the best Guardian Spirits in in on Earth or in heaven because I am not where they said I was going to be I am I am I am a survivor and I'm here and I'm working towards getting that over and done with with my my children and my grandchildren and now my great-grandchildren so I have still another purpose for getting this work done now we've been working as a group for 33 years so I don't know since 1993 anyway we've been working and I it took us two years before we could even talk to each other about her experiences is it took me that long to really trust each other to tell our stories but we did and we got strong and we've been teaching all over not just to our community members what time because of what we were doing what we were quite famous people wanted to hear what with all we did it and how they could get their their bum circle's going and I'll get their Elders strong so we've been traveling you know up and down PC and we've been recorded so many times that we have fun I heard that we have a film or something down in Hollywood in California and then statesiders universities down there they're using our faces down there and then I guess we're quite famous and I didn't even know it so we've been working up quite hard with our our stories and and trying to help as many people as we can but the most important people now or my family my my my children and their children and their their children I just have that hope that though with all of this work that's being done now my biggest and most powerful prayer in the world that's been answered because this is happening today and then I hope it continues that you know something good is going to come I know something good is going to come from it because I'm already I'm already speaking and then people are listening actually listening and hearing what we're saying they're not sitting back and listening and doing okay they're listening and they're saying okay what can we do to help so the hands are out now not enough not to hit you but they're out there to shake your hand and give you a hand to get up from where you are and and be a better person and I'm hoping that the this continues now and that we're going to be healthy and strong mentally physically and spiritually we have to get over the fact that the Catholic church is what I was within that that the church is not the not the one who beat me or break me or you don't get everything they are the ones that the people that were in the schools that's the ones that I have to blame not sure so I'm not here Church bashing so that's what I've been accused of a couple of times but I know now that they're not they're trying to teach you something the people that they sent to do the job didn't know how to do it and they were bad people so where I'm still working with that but I think I'm there now that I'm strong enough I can deal with it I don't discriminate against any religion or anybody I think that time the large the great spirit put all all all colors into Hazel into this world like a beautiful garden and then we are all from the same same Mother Earth doesn't matter what color you are your own brothers and sisters and I just want to keep it that way that any color in your garden is beautiful so welcome everyone and I think that's what I'll all I have to say,82.85,20.26,1,83.99,0.018399264

75,0,1,my name is Fred I like I attended residential school in Saint Marys and the new Mission and Campbell I guess I thought I might as well say captured when I was 9 years old Asian route to Residence after Christmas and it was a big experience for me because I came from our village were going away in and it was by horseback and we had to go to the ferry and I lord of the the people that came from I reserved a they were forced to go to the residential school because the Indian Act I know I don't know if you guys know the history of that I it had sections in there though we're taking out gradually over time and you had to attend school you if you didn't attend school you are considered a delinquent I think there was one line or one payment of the old Indian Act and if their parents didn't send you there than they were they were liable to go to jail or whatever my father didn't want me to go there so because he got away my sister had started going to school and couch and she wasn't great 5 nice nails capture I think about two years later my mom got Damien all all our family ended up with admission by my brother what's two and a half when you haven't even sent there it was a family at that time but it was about seven or eight of us and the top bigger with we all when she ended up at the residential schools experience I want to talk about it is basically what they try to do to you there my mother had taught me how to do math help on everything before I got there but she was raised in the residential school from the time she was a little baby will keep her mother died when she was born and she spent the next 16 years in the residential school I think that experience door. Enable our family to survive often the Wilderness iconic wear we went to town maybe one once or twice a year baguette Bare Necessities like sugar and coffee or some the rest we we we grew or hunted or we did all our own food better own Flour Mill wheat grown weak and stuff but when the irrigation system broke broke up then we had to move my father had to sell his stock you know I consider them all off because he had you don't nearly two hundred head of just about anything then we moved it was that was funny experiences started we all ended up in the residential school and remember the first week especially in Mission first table gave on my first cousin when we went there was feed the pigs yeah this big cartoon Bobcat behind the kitchen and pick it up and you bring it up and feed the pigs the only thing they didn't know what that come from a rodeo family and every time we Apple finish Vietnamese Rivals Pizza and we go to class but we smell really awful so they ship is over to the principal and then we have to go take a shower and change your clothes going on maybe three days then they took those off their will so they said we'll put you in a place where you can't get in trouble of your shovel the manure out of the barn but by the second day we were riding those calls and we're coming out of that barn and they got sour milk so that was the end of our work I guess wait wait we haven't kneel down in front of the Blessed Virgin Mary for about 2-3 months big statue I don't think about it you know that they wanted to break your spirit it didn't matter how happy you wanted to be or try to live and I but I made my mind that they weren't going to do that to me every time I heard a train it reminded me a home but I seen how those people were punished when they were when they ran away that experience along with enough to make you afraid to run away because I seen them really beaten badly and better take their pants down and stop in front of all the students but I wouldn't cooperate I learnt their Sports and everything really well when he asked me to play for the school came and went I wouldn't pay for them so they punished me I have to get a toothbrush and grab the little squares in in the bathroom while the games are going on at the school and so I did that I wouldn't think I was a good athlete but I wouldn't play I want to text you I got sent to Hamilton we got the cameras and we played first thing they ask if we know how to play soccer basketball and so we told we could it Uno 13th Ave wake me in with the men's league in Stockton then the basketball as long as you're good at you you are treated a little different than the rest I sort of learned that after I learned that for Missions experience there I know a lot of the day the good feelings that I had there were probably in my sports page but at the same time admission is where things happen to me that was the only place the sexual abuse and things like that happen. so lot of the problems that I think we've developed after we left that place we were actually I guess times we were given to think which was probably before we went to bed when we think about how we're going to fix this that's why I'm here today work at work feeling I agree with Bob the Next Generation you know if they're here but they are caring what we carry I know I got children here intergenerational things we talked about how does destruction with lady in house over there yesterday and they say all we got funding to help those people so what you're asking are they ever going to get a chance to speak with us here I said with us after the fact Norcross be here we have to involve them not only that my kids but their kids I think reality is hard to fit in when you listen to the politicians like Bob was talking about over there they didn't say anything about what and why they did that or what they were apologizing for I always speak on the word genocide genocide is the biggest word that happen how people died in those schools they died trying to get away from those schools their Spirit was dead when you left there we went that is about all you know when you think about it I always talk about my grand grandson who I raised for the time he was born he said University but a week now I was teaching but who the Creator is it wasn't the God babe they taught us about in those Catholic schools or any of those schools that we went to when they talked about it with all the things that they said we couldn't do they basically they've been taught us that was things and I really feeling better this system TRC know I might have started out as a good thing but the hottest start at our community level and stay there master rebuild auditions are people that you are children when I was sitting at that table when we wrote the resolution to create what we wanted I said Grassroots in those words enjoy was part of that come we are sitting there talking about what we were going to right now and it's sad that we we started failed you can go to any Community anytime you could see what's happening in our community that's where we've been our system is there system the band Thorne Indian axe system even if we're at we we've tried that the different systems a lot of times you look at it and the kids aren't even party there when they should be taught from the time like my grandmother took me away because I was the oldest boy in my bath family I don't know how many kids he had but every one of the boys oldest ones were taken and she talked them she sorta chose was going to do what was give me the management who is going to be the politician all these other things so I I got lots to say lightbulb you but you don't like the time that we talked about here I think would be better spent you could do it in our community so we could actually gain strength from our neighbors and our friends enemies are whoever we're going to call it in the system we run right now I don't know I've been talking about what had to be done but when you talk at this level here you're talking to the political stage that you have no place in a system that word was be trying to develop R-Truth not show it's what I call it here I thought I seen the things that are missing to get to our truth nard my truth is to help my family right from the smallest grandchild or great-grandchild of whoever they are right through to then so we can all hold hands and say we are all working together in a good way no thank you guys for a listening to what little I had to say what I really believe we have to work harder thank you Roberta Simpson Alex,51.77,27.75,1,46.55,0.005910165

And threaten the use God and do his values that they talk about you were the greatest singers of all do I forgive him because in my teachings my secret reach you it's not up to me to judge those people they're the ones that are going to go to the Creator I look at him NB Carnival for their behavior I can be accountable for myself when I think about the seven years that I was at the residential school I take it a Step Beyond surviving that place because I choose to live used to make my world a better place especially for my two children I have two children I raised them by my and if you my one daughter is one of her descendants in her class action or doing and to be able to share her story in court to say that my mother brought me up in a very strictly even on our ceremonies everything was organized in my home everything was scheduled because I was a mother and father to my children and my father was there for my children and I'm thankful for my older sister because even when I was born read from the time today I'm 61 years old we are right the left hand to each other my children if anything should happen to me she look after and vice a versa or grandchildren the same encourage my sister to share her story with her children I think about my brother who lost two fingers at the residential school because he wouldn't pray and my other brother who is used in the boxing championship did when they asked why you drink so much brother you'd want to know you know a lot of people not Community look at us like we're a very prestigious family untouchable we're leaders in our community what we suffer just as much are thankful that we had such a loving mother you know I was 45 years old my dad looked at me and said I love you he was dying he didn't know how to hug a and tell her she love this I'm a sweet ass we're taught to always respect their father nor mother I looked after them till they left this world and I'm thankful because we've learned how to balance our traditional life and educational world of the residential school why people might Community suffer because they cannot deal with the effects and impacts of the residential school we have a higher drug and alcohol problem in our community we're still depended upon our chief and Council to do things for us a long time ago our people were independent when I was young and my father and my uncle would go hunt for the whole village fish for the whole village and never expect anything in return and my dad my Grandpa would go and see the people look after the people that didn't have husbands that and the children common you know we have three people three children in our home and to be able to share our parents was devastating for us likeliness of love and kindness that my mom had my grandmother my mother myself all went to residential school children deserve a better life we are survivors need to go beyond you and be a better person and look and strive for wellness because our grandchildren and seven generations we've been taught to look ahead what do we going to teach our children if we don't want the Moon desire for justice and wellness with dries my community and seashell to have a class action on behalf of the day's goals that were admitted from the school settlement we were even at that level denied and never recognized as being part of that residential school just because we didn't sleep there can you imagine just because you didn't sleep in that building you were left out of the settlement it's not the money it's not about the monetary way it's about affirming honesty truth respect love and honor we were left out my relative here the same way a lot of people in your communities were left out so what are we going to do about that and you're right I don't want to hear about all these things that you don't want to be disrespectful but I'm talking about honesty here it's about students attended that school what do you like listening to that the panel about their recommendations those things come from us because we lived it we entered. I thought today I need to see catelli's threesome you don't think that how we been injured but it we know that we left them when I challenge you to do today is to go beyond that you know what your mind and get into your heart because the healing starts with us we need to live we don't need to be survivors anymore we need to live we need to support each other and you're right you know I organized Regional Community 500 people attended that people sharing their stories it's a lot of hard work but to be able to see we're coming I don't want to do a follow-up healing Workshop,91.62,26.48,1,68.65,0.00248139

80,1,1,hello near me I've always been scared to speak but I am just a little few years I've been speaking I'm very very scared but that's all I got to say about that I didn't even I was on the I'm going to say things just not going to talk about if you send it back I went to the Eminem's I was George I'm from to Oakland from here to Fino and I'm I went to school and that was for eight years and one year I got sick and grape 5 but I really really had with Mark that's all I had and I was surprised how my marks were that's all I get through with work real hard in school cuz everything horrifically worse military and I hope it's at a school and I'll just say a few things about that up it's at a school paper scissors there was molesting the school and it was very military when we would get sprayed by raid because if we were sick or if we have bugs in your head you know it was around though it was horrific in or the smell of that and I actually block this off about the rate and one day when I was older we just can't win and I sell my car I got the realtor lock in theme song and I block molesting off and I'm working on there remember because the body always remember what happened and I never ever and pray and it's very hard not to cry but I'm crying inside since day one anthem doobie I don't want to say this but my parents were in residential school and it was horrified going home to from the day school it was just like residential school and I'm two people to see it you know how many times have we got to know only got a lot of bad and not everything turned out to be like our parents and pass it on to our children and our grandchildren my dad right now things to say but I am working through it I'm not forgetting about at dinner we don't forget the wood I just then went to residential school in Port Alberni and I also have blocks there but I'm starting to remember I was barricaded and raped and molested all night but I'm still remembering are having their hand on my mouth I can talk about that but anyway um I took a drug in this residential school and blacked out immediately that's why I can't remember though the barricaded anti-rape I'm going through it and I am remembering the my body is remembering and I will be going to court probably in a year from now it has been horrific for me and um I've been really quiet person and unable to speak and I'm scared of people you know I am called myself ugly since day one and today I still think I'm ugly and stupid I am working really hard on not calling myself ugly anymore and I've been doing that for a while and it's still very very hard and there's so many things that need changes I especially want to mention that our children need to be protected our children aren't protected in these courthouses and I am very very upset and I want this Truth and Reconciliation or whatever whoever's dealing with it to do something about our children they're being molested and they're being torn apart and he's courthouses and I know because my grandchildren are having panic attacks at five and six years old and don't nobody I believe the courthouse over 2 years anthem things have been changing for me and that I would like to say someone that'll help you know with asthma asthma hasn't been very kind it's just like a residential school of the way they treat our children it's the same thing over and over in the courthouse is a more one-sided unfair and this is important pretty I'm sure it's all over the place but I totally believe my grandchildren and I really am suffering and we're supposed to get them back not to the courthouse and it is going to be through the Creator and the answers there said my grandchildren are going to be returned to mother my daughter and I pray every morning and every night in my own words to the Creator because I was also brainwashed in the soap it's at a school I was on forced into Catholic religion and brainwash that I'm going to burn in hell you know and there's a picture this girl thinks a disciplined as you're going to burn in hell. as I got older remember noticed I would freak out I'm going to go to hell I'm going to burn in hell and it took a long time for me to pray Injustice year I've been praying morning and night for my grandchildren and I totally would like a change service Martha Ministry the courthouses and they're totally ignoring any reports of abuse ever done to my grandchildren and my grandchildren I don't want to go back they said we have to bring it back because they need to change the law and help our children because this is it you know our people need to change we need our identity back and our government our native politicians are native politicians have to change and not live like in the government puppet Runway and all our beds especially my band do with being coverman puppet run against their own people pleaser of the residential school and stop being stuck work on your healing work on abuses go forward and don't stop there is so many things I want to say but we are not like we are native people and I want our Native Wings back we are against each other's all our bands are against each other and that is very very sad I bet our people to change please for our grandchildren are future and the way we could treated by our own people even though I'm disabled people I'm disabled doesn't look like it but I am and the elders a lot of the elders get abused I've seen it you know like in nice Homestead they call Elders homes I don't know what you call it it still need like a residential school but I think our elders are important I think we all are important then the violence is still here this is what we learn from the residential school to be against each other file and there is molesting going on that is very hard to say but it has to be stopped government and past governments are racist and hatred all Native people and this world is the same way and I know they're good people out there that aren't that way but there's very few my government power over us and I think we can take our power back when we heal and we don't need to go to Know chords for going fishing or anywhere or doing anything like that and we don't even need to go to court for children we don't need to call the courts for anything this government thing has to stop we need to be back to ourselves as we are good to each other you know what just to say hi to somebody or smile like that one lady was sitting somewhere this is how our people we've always been that way mulatto happiness last night at the talent show I've never seen so many happy Natives and I hope that's what we'll be back in special please tell me the part that grandchildren I hope I didn't forget what I really wanted to say but I'm just so upset about them the government racist violence is still happening I know I suffered a lot through that I'm not going to anymore because I'm learning to be a Healer service operator and our ancestors and I have been doing I just started doing the healing and I can through healing and I am very blessed and proud of it and I am blessed and protected right now and

81,1,0,"can you hear me Elvis have this worried that I'm not going to be hurt my name is Louise Martin on from the slope with First Nations been at this little island across from Tofino BC I have roots from cloak with test with a headset alert Bay and I also European ancestry from buddy my grandmother's and I've been sober for 32 years and drug-free for that amount of time also I mean and it makes me happy to see that because I come from the same stories that all First Nations people have been talking about since we've been here and in Victoria that there's any the one in I don't know specifically but you know where everything is been and it's been really difficult for me to be speaking and I'm amazed that I can speak because of the horrific abuse that I suffered and it was like being in residential school because I was abused by a lot of my own people my parents used to drink a lot and they go to different reserves and I get abused there and I think that you're very much Elder for saying that they were thought to be pedophiles that's where it came from and it is I really love you for saying that I was kind of scared to see things today but you gave me the courage and strength to say thank you to me it is really really tough to two be resilient when you finish so abused by your own people right now I'm happy to be wearing this show because all my life I haven't been a cultural person and it's made me feel bad because I don't know how to dance my sisters and my brothers dance and thing thing I'm the second oldest in my family and I'm the one who doesn't then so used to seeing into cultural things but in the last well if I've done a lot of healing on myself in I have still hard time and I have been so touched by people that have spoken here in its in sweeping Europe became Wednesday in I've been shaking away and I have a real hard time and I can feel people's pee man understand what's happened and I would also like to say that I was real happy I was told one day by a teacher North Island College that it was we that kick-started the residential school healing naked see I'm from the new channels and I spoke with sexual abused in 1989 and November and maybe it's not true but he made me feel happy and I was able to speak more about sexual abuse since and he told me that then I've been told that a couple more times lady at University was telling me she was writing my speech to teach people at the University but what happened to you channeled people so anyway I actually had no voice at all in I've been learning since I've been healing to speak and I still have difficult time but a lot of different things have happened to me a lot of nice things like I quit drinking when I was 29 and I'll be 62 and May in a long time you know I was a shame to be native because people were always calling us dirty drunk and stupid Indians were good for nothing in ashamed and then I went to Round Lake treatment center and I love the people there I met people from all over the place a lot of native people and I went to sweat lodge I never done that before and I was real scared cuz I felt stupid because I never did anything cultural before but thank you to the people from Round Lake for sharing their sweat lodge with me and all the time only 30 years that I've been talking I've been things have been happening for me I'm on time was at home in my apartment and I had a real nice experience I was in my bedroom and I was walking towards my closet and all of a sudden it was like this tornado went through me in it came into me and I had total peace and that the first time I ever had a native neatest thing happened to me and I was just totally Blown Away by the total piece that I had and a fellow came to see me you was at Sundance and that's what it was in I never forgot it and I love that because it was native I started I started waking up then that is the first Native thing that happened to me so I appreciate that have an affinity for people that share their culture with other with other First Nations people I was really enjoying that were a music CDs where it means we're all one I don't know if I'm pronouncing it right but damn you it's not how you pronounce it I don't know if somebody said it was from I think alert Bay the number Keys people not sure I can't remember now but anyways so I know that I came here for a reason and I've been All Shook Up about coming here today and would like to explain to you that I'm a medium and I speak for and sisters and I had a lot of messages from her ancestors and I remember once I was told to say something's in the lady she came back at me at a meeting I went to tribal council meeting in she said to me you she said she was looking right at me and she said there's people in this room that are trying to make brownie points she said in I never tried to make any brownie points and I was real sad and I didn't feel like talking again but I realized that I was told what to say and the message from our ancestors is that they don't want treaties happening no more treaties and I was at my daughter's place about maybe 6 weeks ago she went to the University of Victoria and she had a book it was called Canada's Canada's Indians and I don't know for some reason I just picked up this book and there's a there's a chapter in there and I remember the one line I didn't want to read anymore all it said was the treaties haven't worked in the past and I added while treaties are working in the present because we were too. totally the opposite of what needs to be done we're not here you are the people that are immigrants you're the European and Asian people we don't need any rights there are right because this is our ancestral home and this is some message from our ancestors that we don't need to ask for fishing rates like my cousin Dallas said we don't need to go to court to get her children that it's alright to get her children back our grandchildrenyou don't have to ask for permission to start business and stuff it's it's totally the other way around in the other message that I have is that we need to stop bickering about trivial things and do things that like I was real happy because I read that I was on internet I thought myself out of go on internet I got a computer I heard a Native American fallacy where stewards of the land and I believe that and we need to start making sure that there's no more pollution that was one of the messages no more pollution we have every right to say no more pollution and the other messages that native children need to have food all the time shelter protection love care and these are the most important things that the messages that I got from the ancestors Indian it's it's scary talking in like I get carried away sometimes saying this but I know that I'm supposed to say these things that I've said and I wanted to see you know there's only 1 million six hundred thousand then some number native people in Canada it makes me feel real said the population I was looking at on in Canada's 36 million so that's how many immigrants live other than 35 million people complain about us so much every little thing that we do there's so much complaining and why because we're such small numbers and people Lillian support stuff it's time to stop the bullying in the other thing that I'd like to say is a boy the immigrants I was taught in school about problems math problems and that everyone is everyone of us on this land this is part of the problem and we need to we need to solve it all together is important things that I would like to mention to or I read a book by Allison Miller and she was talking about she was talking about rodabaugh Hitler and a fellow named joke SQ and she was talking about how church asked you was starving people in Romania while he was living high on the hog that's the best way I can describe it right now this is where the problem comes in I'm not here try to make people feel ashamed or guilty of what's happened I'm here to say that we aren't only people that need to heal immigrants that came to our land maybe he'll also and look at where they come from until that part of their own lives that they haven't been wanting to look at because people came here for a better life it we're the ones were starving I've heard it day after day that we're the ones were starving we're like to ask you as orphans and we don't need that anymore that's why they said that it's really important for Native children all Native children all children to have food if you can see the difference in people that have food and the people who don't have flute alcoholism is rampant in in in Porter families and it's because they're fighting and deficient we need all our vitamins and it's important for people to have their food whatever area they come from 2 to survive and we don't need anybody's permission to survive and we had a lot of racism in this land with me my cousin we're riding on the bus and other thing in some white woman was giving as the dirtiest look and I felt sorry for her because she was looking at us like we're the scum-of-the-earth because we didn't have clothes like hurts and it's not close that make a person it's a heart and the soul I felt so sorry for that lady I don't know if you know what support, but I could see karma coming to her in anyways I Die Young I lost my train of thought but anyway um I mean I waited for you to come in here and I wanted to let you know that I'm psychic in since I've been here and I've been getting real psychic and them I've seen things which reminds me the ancestors also spoke and said that they know what's going on on our land everything that's going on and people will be brought to justice for what's been happening in particular native women and children being murdered in Canada I know what's going on and it will be it was murdered as well be brought to Justice and people the native people are going to start healing big time after this tears you fend and LS my cousin here learned a method of healing people and I remember we were in Tofino my sister nor and find it as to Tofino to speak at the cultural Hall app it sit in there was a cop on there it's at the end and I was thinking about DNA that it's all in there it's all in there DNA in there and sister said that once we start
