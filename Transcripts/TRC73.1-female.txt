Welcome to our territory from the Squamish nation and I live in Squamish where I was born I was brought into this world by my grandmother and my auntie's and that was checked over about a month later by the doctor and said I was fine and I'm still here 71 years later Miami happy to be here because I know from that experience is that my am I could be anywhere I am in heaven right now maybe with my sisters because I lost three sisters them because they had been sexually abused when they're three four and five and it wasn't by the school people that were you know it was by the some of the survivors of self to Cayman they aren't they were just trying to do pedophiles and in the schools that's what they did the best that that's what they did best I am I miss my my mom too because she was in a residential school as well and my dad and he had a double whammy because he was in the war I didn't meet him until I was about six or seven years old just before I went to residential school he came home and I had never met him before but when it came to the door and knocked on the door and said Shirley said you and I said well it's me cuz I'm here is Djibouti you said I'm here Dad message okay so I unlocked the door go to understanding understand them standing there at the door and I just threw myself on him I give him a great big hug and a city so that was my welcome him home from the war I don't think he could have gotten anything better in this world from using oldest daughter and them the term I have been sick for awhile before it went through as a dental school ahead that are rheumatic fever and they used to have fun tonight my uncle and some of them were younger than myself it's my mom and and her mom we're having children at the same time set alarm but they use the first round in the buggy and them because I was not allowed to be stressed I was supposed to be resting all that I'm not walking or running around so these to push me around the reserve on a buggy and we have this hell up then stop missing please put me on the top and push me down then somebody would be at the other end to catch me and that was me resting so what was he know I had such beautiful times and that it was you know a lot of good things happening at when I was at home but there I know there was one pedophile on a reserve and then he tried to touch me and I went screaming home and because my grandfather was well-respected man in the non RS he went there with other other men and told that man he was not welcome on the reserve anymore he had to leave so he moved on to the states and he never came back so I hope but I hope that he didn't continue his horrible teachings down there but I have the things that happened before I went to residential school but were caused by residential school and they were teaching our I don't know when I went to school and I was wondering why I couldn't go and visit my my cousins they were on the other side of the playing field I was on the girls side they were on the boys side and we weren't allowed to go over and talk to them or play with them or anything and I wondered why you know my mic my first cousins and my second cousins they're all my brothers and I couldn't go and talk to them anymore and I never could figure out why we were so you know separated but I tried to talk to one of my cousins cuz he was walking through the girls side alyssum he had to carry something over it as I was going over and talking to him and you know it just everyday stuff and now he ceases Shirley's girls you're not even supposed to come over and talk to me and I couldn't wait to me it was like a slap in the face to say oh my God I can't even talk to me now we've been playing together and sleeping together in the same bed since we're kids since I was born in here I can't talk to him and I can't even go and look at them or anything was really hurtful enough to be told that I couldn't see him talk to him or anything I'm wondering now that we know speaking of sexual abuse at home Jimmy after a while I started realizing they're in there it was happening all around us and in the school does that mean because they didn't touch me physically that I was not affected by the sexual abuse because it was there it was in in another room and I knew something bad was happening but I wasn't sure what it was so you know it I was sexually abused mentally good because they told me I couldn't talk to my my cousins and I am you knew that they were doing bad things to the girls and the boys in another room and I knew it was happening so you know Define sexual abuse that is that is that a form of or is it too is it not I don't know but it's been such a horrible at Minho it was a horrible experience and them and then not being able to talk about your moon and nobody telling you what it was or when it was going to happen or you know that was something to be ashamed of you know they took that away from me even because you know it's an honor it's it's a real true honor to be a woman and I couldn't do anything about it because I didn't know anything about it didn't teach me how to take care of myself or even tell me why I was bleeding I thought I was dying and you know it was it's just what what did I get from residential school other than your bad feelings and the only good feelings I had words when I was talking to my my cousin she's the one who looked after me she's older than me
