I thought today I need to see catelli's threesome you don't think that how we been injured but it we know that we left them when I challenge you to do today is to go beyond that you know what your mind and get into your heart because the healing starts with us we need to live we don't need to be survivors anymore we need to live we need to support each other and you're right you know I organized Regional Community 500 people attended that people sharing their stories it's a lot of hard work but to be able to see we're coming I don't want to do a follow-up healing Workshop
