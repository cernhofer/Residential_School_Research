going to take a short break to have lunch probably .5 minutes half hour to 45 minutes today one that was going to Second Circle will come back here south part of RR of our Circle that now there were others that were here earlier and now I guess they have other things to do but we're going to continue continue on to the second Circle and down you're going to be next Genesis only second Circle yeah I have to yeah I have to do the closing prayer maybe I can share just a little a little bit more than what I did earlier I think that was the whole concept of having a second Circle or so to bring up the bring up the help me bring up the memories then and now able to answer some of the questions or to share some of the the story so you will you will know where are your parents came from or your and he's are or your uncle's to help to understand what happened what happened to our people and on some research stayed it still continuing all the all this dysfunction that happen that's going on on our Reserves bottom I would like to to share this with you um I was so while everyone was speaking and it also brought up memories different memories because of being there 7 years is like being there 70 years it was so so much that that happened and um and Audrey my years of a appealing, I kind of um I guess the Press them or it doesn't bother me as much anymore it that as it used to because now I know where I where I'm at in life and I know who I am and where I'm going Madame one of the one of the memories that I have had had was up when when we were very young when I first entered residential school every night when we go back in September every night for about maybe one or two months I would hear the the the young girls crying and even sometimes to do you like the older ones and you could hear the mat at night time when was time to go to bed and that used to make me feel bad and I would I would be crying too I would cry for them and I'm after I was in school maybe three or four years and then I stop that crying cuz I knew then that there was no way out for me that I had that was part of my life I had already I guess some how would you say it I guess I died I just headed in me instilled in me that this was this was life for me so I accepted it and I quit I quit crying and another incident when we when I begin the circle and the early 1990 we still go to different places like Bird Island and um actually we have some in Spanish too as well there were memories memories cave came really flooding back as to some of the the students would wood well we talked about it would mention I had a good time there I had to work nothing wrong with the school and I had to really really think about 144 why why am I why am I complaining why are these memories really Vivid in my mind and I didn't like I couldn't recall at that time anything good happening to me because I became a rebel when I was in school that was part of my survival when I'm when all the teachers with would mention something about the reserve Reserve Life or the ones we left back home or or anything like that or else do we were not part of that Society anymore and that we couldn't go back to the our reserves with then go back home because of the drinking and there are parents to wait a drink and I used to tell myself was she talking about my mother and her drink a day in her life my mother didn't even swear they in her life she never smoked so I had installed in my mind that they were lying so I start blocking a lot of things went when they would come in there or she would come and I could see the anger in her I would just block everything I would block her because I knew what you was what you was going to say and um I left there in 1952 and I want to dear I left in in the summer that's all I was still in contact with some of the girls that I knew really well at that time that we're still in school and I used to write to them and they used to try to tried to coax me to go to return back to school and they were they were mentioning things like the school system has really changed now we we can go we were free to go and walk to the Village we have a intermingling with the with the village kids because now they're attending school in Spanish because there's their school I guess burned down so they had that interaction with the outside world and I figured I've heard of myself you're just trying to trick me to go back there are you hope things are still spending in my mind and I've heard no that's a trick and I'm not going back there and I heard actually yes did that the school system had changed there was a lot more freedom they were able to wear their own clothes I didn't have to wear these then you type of prison clothes that I see she used to see the the women in prison with and and I guess things to change and then when I start relating to the story said other survivors were or telling their story and saying oh no that's cool what's a night that I was in high school we were able to do things we leave we were even able to curl Ur hair we were able to walk up to do it all out to the Village we were able to visit our brothers and I figured well that's a big change that came it wasn't like that when I was there there they were so strict very very strict when I was there and they were so strict I ran away and that I made it really really hard on myself the last year I attended school I ran away I ran away that fall and and the rest of the year they made it hell for me and I became a rebel after that I became a rebel and even with Society the anger was there always I was always on edge always ready to defend myself arcade event anyone that was native that was around me if I seen someone saying something to a native that was it wasn't respectful I would be right in there you know helping and arguing so that's what that's what happened to me part of the story there's still a lot a lot more yet for me to share and hopefully I can help anyone that that may be going through life and wondering and wondering what's wrong with the family or or maybe what's wrong with you within yourself because I went I walked around in society for many years before I could find answers to all the questions I had in my mind with that I'd like to see me watch
