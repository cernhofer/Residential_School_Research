Bowser watching Rachel Garrick National cause I'd like to recognize and acknowledge the elders today and then I'd also like to recognize the survivors that are here today and on are you I myself am from l'axel first nation which is in Northwestern Ontario IMO decree so I have the best of both worlds from Hunter my mother was I'm an intergenerational Survivor my mother went to residential school the Pelican Fallsat school and she was there for eight years as a child growing up I was some I experienced dumb a lot of the effects that many intergenerational people discuss such as lost a culture I don't speak my language my mom speak Soulja Boy Soulja cree and create her first language was cree and she did not teach me list my father speaks would you weigh he did not teach me this they thought that the language and culture would not do me any any good and that's what they believed so they decided not to teach me my language and sometimes when people here that I don't speak my language though I feel ashamed because I don't understand it and and that they don't understand that it was not talk to me and but right now I have the choice I can learn it and that's my choice so I'm learning my language languages so I have a few of them to learn but I'm on my way and fortunately might I have two children I have a daughter and a son and because I myself am went through a Learning Journey that's what I call it um and I went through this journey for a reason I'll just give you a quick background of of what I went through quite quickly my mother was an alcoholic and my father what was he was raised in a little tiny Community where they had to survive together so he was raised with the old values of community and relying on each other to survive and I was given those values A Lot quickly tell you a story here I heard them Robert till story about Tom unseen drunken Indians on the street well in where I grew up about five years old has walking Uptown with my dad and I seen a group of people drinking drunk on the street and I pointed at them because that I had learned this from my peers I pointed at them and said that look at all those drunken Indians expecting him to to say something in and agree with me but you know what he said you said they're not drunken Indians there people there and he told me their name he told me their history is why they drink and from that one experience I learned to look at people at human be and not to judge them and that was important teaching that I brought forward in my life also on another teaching that my father taught me was we went up town again this was probably about a year later we went up town and now I happen to find a Dollar on the ground and then back then a dollar with a lot money so I said yeah I'm going to go buy myself a pop and maybe some chips but my dad said well he says why don't you give that dollar that you found to somebody who you think really needs he says and I'll match your dollar for my dollar so I said thinking he's crazy I want to give away my daughter but I agreed because out of respect for my father and the love that I had for him but I thought he was crazy none-the-less so we went Uptown and remember that one story that really touched me and affected me about this one man and I seen him sitting there so I went up to him and I was scared I had heard his story and I felt so connected with this man so I went up to him he was sitting like you are you sitting like this so I went up to him and I said here and he looked at me and just that look that he gave to me it no words can express how I felt at that moment it was like I recognized him as a human being I was giving him a dollar and for me I felt like he felt that he was invisible before that and nobody cared so when I gave him that dollar it was the best feeling in the world I had never experienced something like that I was so used to keeping my toys to myself and not doing anything but that was a real gift for me that day and something I'll never forget that was the gift of giving and my father gave me that gift but them on to it it's kind of sidetracked here but from that teaching I've passed that on that's my choice to past that teaching on I've done teaching with my own children in hopes that they'll pass it on and that Phil gift they'll learn how to not to judge others but to look at people as human beings so that's one of the things that I took took away with those teachings with residential school get back to that and then my again my mother went to school and she shared with me her experiences as well in terms of by what she experienced a lot of the physical abuse emotional abuse and she shared those with me when I was young so I could understand why she does some of the things that but she did and I did not have an ideal dealt with by any means I myself was physically abused emotionally abused but for me there's there's another story come from story tell there's another story that she told me and it was about my great-grandmother they let you still live in a little tiny village and it was a Cree Village and my great-grandmother was 83 at the time this one Rogue whilst it was alone what was coming into the community and it was starting to eat the pets the dog that we're around and the community was getting fearful because it was coming in during the daytime and they were steering for the kids so the men from the community set traps like the Iron Wolf traps to catch the wolf and this wasn't working they had gone a couple weeks and it still wasn't working in my a great the grandmother what she had done was the she had said to the men you have lost your way she said this wolf is here to teach us a lesson she said it's here to show us that we must remember our old ways and keep them he says so I'm going to go out and I'm going to go get this will she said the old way so sure enough she nobody could talk her out of it either because she was the matriarch of the family so she went out and she she she was going for a couple of days and on this one evening all the woman had said to the man you have to go out and find her now because they had thought for sure she was she was dead so I guess they're getting ready to go out and find her they yeah it could hear some footsteps coming down the trail that she had walked and here it was her and on the back of her sled was the wolf so that was a big lesson for the community itself not to forget their way and so that story was passed on to me and again I passed that on to my children so that they don't forget that that woman's be a blood runs through my feet and I have her Warrior I am a warrior just as much as she was and then my mother who was a warrior she served
