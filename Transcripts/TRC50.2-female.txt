And I have trouble sitting in a classroom if I hear a loud voice I can't very intimidated why get intimidated is crazy when you hear that woman rating in your face you think everybody is the same sometimes when you hear voices I can draw you the whole scene Outback residential school I could probably draw the women's faces because sometimes I've been fighting I've been fighting with addictions all my life I remember when I went to I think I was like 16 years old I went to Pine Grove for like 45 days bean and pod girl in the dorm reminded me of the residential school I didn't go back to Pine Grove I became an isolator in my own home today I have a very hard time trusting or believing in anyone why because all started when I was like five six years old then the system Bender street life streetlife came to dry drunk I think I think if you're going to be a dry drunk before I just get drunk could a dry drunk is worse than being a drunk but I'm here today because I want to help I want to help these people I want I'm going to go back to the street that's all I know if the street like the foster home life that is where I'm going back as a health worker I will sit on a street corner in the back alley watch my buddies do their effect and drink why cuz when I needed somebody when I tried to OD there's nobody there and all they need is somebody to sit there and talk with them they don't need somebody to sit there and judge them just because they are just the wrong way I watch it every one I look at all these people that were once in the same place as ours I watch some that's been there and now they turn their faces on where they came from you cannot deny where you come from all you could do this Make Yourself Strong make yourself stand so you can grab your sister your brother's hand and go walking into hey it's okay it's okay to shut it dear it's okay to be like that but we know once you start showing them the love the compassion they'll change their hearts because then they'll start to believe in themselves when you get told not to talk you lose the inside of you you talk you could told you're a liar why because they don't want to sit there and hear hear what you have to say just another way for them to cover their butts I got to crunch because you what if I'm not crunching and I'm scratching so I rather be crunching oh you got time I guess my time is ready I've got so much I need to say so much I want to say I don't care about money I don't care about anything I just all I care about is helping me get a healthy so I can go and help those other people get healthy walk with me until I'm able to walk on my own people don't forget where you come from don't look down on your buddies next to you you see somebody hungry either get some something to eat you are so sweet those people there on the street they're asking for change don't get them to change get them food because why you're just helping them to kill himself talk about all the residential schools I've been in every one of them it was bad like I did hook up with a guy that was from the residential school I hit lived his pain I know what just before you how to keep flapping flapping in Flatbush
