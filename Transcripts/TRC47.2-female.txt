I just wanted to let you know that I am thankful for being here today and I'm really glad that the donut play cuz if my brothers would have thought that likely would have been really really angry home I have some when I saw that play got you I got really angry and I just thought of my brother automatically and I'm so happy that time I'm so happy that died but he wasn't here to see if he would have really really upset over it I spoke my sister this morning and I told her I was coming into the healing the ceiling 3: she just told me that speak for my heart and let things out I'm an artist tune Hydro picture of my granddaughter I was holding her and I wrote a little poem to her house Loretta robotic University in the phone and really emotional I was holding her and I told her I was writing a story to her and I told her I said I'm so glad my granddaughter that you don't have that when you look out the window you don't eat your brick building or you don't need to wake up enough to beat the see if you can watch TV you can watch cartoons all day and I told my granddaughter or not poem I said you don't know if you don't have to be labeled anymore you could be called by your name you don't have to have a number 5 for number 10 or 15 and 12 like what I done I had and I told my granddaughter that you're free to dance and sing talk in your language I said a lot of things in my poem that are really emotional but I dedicated that my my granddaughter the seventh generation and we are the ones that broke the ice and my kids are the ones through more less like putting High keep telling my kids are you guys up to help Mom put her cookies together and I'm really glad that I have them because you know we would sit around and we have a good cry and Weiner talks and if it wasn't for them I like them they keep me going I'm going to discontinue my healing process I am I pray a lot of my time and there was a point where I just didn't want to I just hate a church so much I just hate it with a passion piano my brother died like I didn't want him to go into the church there are the ones done damage to him I have so much hurt against the church in then I'm so much wrong with my family
