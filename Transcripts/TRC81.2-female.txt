totally the opposite of what needs to be done we're not here you are the people that are immigrants you're the European and Asian people we don't need any rights there are right because this is our ancestral home and this is some message from our ancestors that we don't need to ask for fishing rates like my cousin Dallas said we don't need to go to court to get her children that it's alright to get her children back our grandchildrenyou don't have to ask for permission to start business and stuff it's it's totally the other way around in the other message that I have is that we need to stop bickering about trivial things and do things that like I was real happy because I read that I was on internet I thought myself out of go on internet I got a computer I heard a Native American fallacy where stewards of the land and I believe that and we need to start making sure that there's no more pollution that was one of the messages no more pollution we have every right to say no more pollution and the other messages that native children need to have food all the time shelter protection love care and these are the most important things that the messages that I got from the ancestors Indian it's it's scary talking in like I get carried away sometimes saying this but I know that I'm supposed to say these things that I've said and I wanted to see you know there's only 1 million six hundred thousand then some number native people in Canada it makes me feel real said the population I was looking at on in Canada's 36 million so that's how many immigrants live other than 35 million people complain about us so much every little thing that we do there's so much complaining and why because we're such small numbers and people Lillian support stuff it's time to stop the bullying in the other thing that I'd like to say is a boy the immigrants I was taught in school about problems math problems and that everyone is everyone of us on this land this is part of the problem and we need to we need to solve it all together is important things that I would like to mention to or I read a book by Allison Miller and she was talking about she was talking about rodabaugh Hitler and a fellow named joke SQ and she was talking about how church asked you was starving people in Romania while he was living high on the hog that's the best way I can describe it right now this is where the problem comes in I'm not here try to make people feel ashamed or guilty of what's happened I'm here to say that we aren't only people that need to heal immigrants that came to our land maybe he'll also and look at where they come from until that part of their own lives that they haven't been wanting to look at because people came here for a better life it we're the ones were starving I've heard it day after day that we're the ones were starving we're like to ask you as orphans and we don't need that anymore that's why they said that it's really important for Native children all Native children all children to have food if you can see the difference in people that have food and the people who don't have flute alcoholism is rampant in in in Porter families and it's because they're fighting and deficient we need all our vitamins and it's important for people to have their food whatever area they come from 2 to survive and we don't need anybody's permission to survive and we had a lot of racism in this land with me my cousin we're riding on the bus and other thing in some white woman was giving as the dirtiest look and I felt sorry for her because she was looking at us like we're the scum-of-the-earth because we didn't have clothes like hurts and it's not close that make a person it's a heart and the soul I felt so sorry for that lady I don't know if you know what support, but I could see karma coming to her in anyways I Die Young I lost my train of thought but anyway um I mean I waited for you to come in here and I wanted to let you know that I'm psychic in since I've been here and I've been getting real psychic and them I've seen things which reminds me the ancestors also spoke and said that they know what's going on on our land everything that's going on and people will be brought to justice for what's been happening in particular native women and children being murdered in Canada I know what's going on and it will be it was murdered as well be brought to Justice and people the native people are going to start healing big time after this tears you fend and LS my cousin here learned a method of healing people and I remember we were in Tofino my sister nor and find it as to Tofino to speak at the cultural Hall app it sit in there was a cop on there it's at the end and I was thinking about DNA that it's all in there it's all in there DNA in there and sister said that once we start healing once native people all across Canada and the states start healing those those memories of your families that way then he'll be waiting healing is going to come back it already started in Dallas so I'm real grateful to you Alice and I thank you so much because she helped me to heal a relationship that I had with my mom and it was through our ancestors way of healing so I thank you very much and I look forward to working with you more and I thank you all for listening here thank you very much Michael gillick
