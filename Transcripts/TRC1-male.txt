Tylerhow do you say thank you forhypertension can I just going to be in Georgia I got shoes you got moved again now my family you guys are kind of structure You Say My Name by doing up I always thought that as my given name this site until I got a little older and I realize. My Christian name is Frank. When I first came into the room near Alvin directed me to this chair I have a feeling that he's always telling me but that's his nature the set of his people to be the first one to talk I guess so I went through many experiences in the residential school that I went to I got a buck today in many ways emotionally physically spiritually random what are the day that I die I can recall very clearly is getting punished and strapped for speaking my language I was at Pelican residential school for a year and I went too far from the truth if I said I got struck every day because of speaking my language when I went to the school that is the only language I could speak and understand and I did not speak English so in order to communicate with my fellow students I spoke my language and the first day of us trapped I'm a rebel by Nature I just shat myself well I want to speak it again so they can strap me again and before I got down to the playground area I will sent right back up to the principal's office again I was the first day and then from then on it just happened a pretty well are recurring punishment for me who made me stronger to keep my language. That is one thing that they would not be able to take away from me and I think throughout the year that I was in Pelican that is what would give me the strength to stay at an end and I keep my language the end of school hi I ran away to I ran away pretty well every week even in the dead of winter at 40 below iiii is to run away you were times when I when I almost came close to dying because of that I spent six weeks in a hospital 767 weeks because I freeze my feet and took me that long to recuperate when are the things that you know I can deal with that the physical the emotional nature of what I went through and really really bothers me to this day it just a spiritual onslaught of my belief system is it still happening today and I said because some before going into the residential school system my father my mother all the would be raised in a Christian family setting would always peaches for the prospective. God or the Creator it is it is too passionate God the Creator is kind God the Creator is so it isn't the kind of being that you want to get. And in the residential school system Andrew God was presented to me in a different light as being detrimental fire and brimstone type of preaching that went on prevented me from getting closer to my creator today because I struggle with this because when I see my native spirituality is one but I'm trying to hang on to it to hold onto but it's time believing in some aspects of the Christian teaching my parents raised me with the cultural component of my spirituality it is still looked at the SS something that is not evil he would buy my own Seafood by my elders because they've been raised in them by the church that their ways are ways were he and I I struggle with that tonight I work with young people I try to find a Middle Road to Nowhere to take the young people when I talk to them about the importance of our of our culture of our Traditions when I talk to them about the drum when I talk to them about the ceremonies when I talk to them about about smudging Wendy Elders of my community or in other communities here. I am talk to the young people about these things they tell me metric acorns, Wisconsin don't teach the young people the evil ways and that really hurts me at one time when I was a chief in my community a young girl holding out the high school came to my house and she said that when I was out there I know you taught me how to make a jingle dress and I love dancing in my jingle dress but I come home and and the drum is not allowed in my community and I'm not allowed to dance with my dingo she looked at me she said do I have to wait until my elders pass on until they die off before I can put my jingle dress on and dance always really strict recording and me knowing that the residential school sister's party responsible for that but at the same time are the partners that were involved in and ready for school system the church's we're the ones that told our elders from way back tattoos wait or evil one simply put their part of our culture every other race of people in this in this world enjoy holding their dances and the African nation in Asia everywhere but we Turtle Island are not permitted to do that and I'd really that really puts a lot of pain and and and and me because I know that you talk about identity that our young people have lost that identity we have lost it because of certain policies that were put in place by the government and end in along with the church those policies and make sure that that we didn't the practice our tradition in our culture and it's going through for me and my community is going to take a long time before that can I can be brought back and then but I hope that one day that I will see about that that's a lie I don't want to say too much I just wanted to bring that out as part of what what what what gives me a lot of a lot of anger and pain I guess in terms of the residential school Legacy makeup I'm even questioning our Joe demick
