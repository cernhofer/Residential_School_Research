hello my name is Judge Gerald Morin I'm amazing person originally from Green Lake Northwestern Saskatchewan drone metal late for those people who don't know where it is for me it's been a real difficult couple of days or a few days I guess being part of this this Gathering here in Saskatoon I'm going to a lot of different emotions and feelings and I came here yesterday and it wasn't my plan to come here and fill out a form or to be sitting in this sharing cericola I really wasn't sure what to expect that I had heard about it though being advertised in Saskatoon in quartz how is interested and I showed up and then it's almost like I stumbled my way here this morning you know like yesterday I filled out the form and then these different categories and I wasn't sure what box to put the my accent or whatever you know and I I'm sorry I put myself down as a survivor and I feel very uncomfortable about that about that whole categorization you know the whole thing about the language in labels and I don't know if I'm a Survivor or fun a victim or something else you know and I question whether I should even be sitting here this morning you know and it's very very difficult but anyway reason I put myself down as a Survivor is because in Greenlake we had a day school and they schools are generally are not on the list and st. Pascal School in Greenlake which I attended is not on the list of residential schools that are recognized by the government of Canada so we're not part of this in some ways I guess in many ways we're not part of the we conciliation process we're not part of the compensation package although I myself and probably close to have to community Ashley filled out the application forms and half have filed and and we did that you know what I was talking monster sells the screen Lakers that we should do this not because we knew we are going to receive compensation or when you were not on the list but we we started thought well if we do this then you know it's a good strategy to put pressure on the government to recognize this day school to st. Pascal School in Green Lake AZ as a residential school as they consider it as part of the package in and that we should be entitled to compensation they had the it's a Roman Catholic Community the church was involved with with the schooling there for many years I was there from for quite a few years when I started and I must have been about five years old I guess I can't really remember too much but when I graduated back in 1981 from st. Pascal School in Greenlake it was like I think that day or two before I turned 20 years old it took me awhile because the I filled a couple of times when I was in elementary school and I think when I was in high school I think I left one so I dropped out but came back and I think I was throwing out once so is there for many years do anyway many of us feel that these forms and and although I don't know why I didn't suffer like sexual abuse in in in in the school myself you know I'd I think from what I seen you was in a fair amount of physical abuse and certainly severe emotional abuse from my perspective Anna and I think the school should be included on the list they should be entitled to compensation they should be part of the reconciliation process that should be welcomed very very difficult you know with that kind of experience being amazing person do to come forward and to be part of anything to share your experiences you know you feel like God your experience is not not legitimate you know it hasn't been is validated it is very difficult you know I wonder sometimes that's why I say I don't know if I'm a Survivor or if I'm still a victim and then many of my people to make people are still being victimized from the way I see it you know like I just know recognition and many respect there's no recognition to respect us as a people in our existence as a people is questioned in Canada our rights are not recognized and respected their severe discrimination and oppression which continues right through this day the victimization continuous and I think you know I don't I don't take anything away from from residential school survivors those people that they have shared their stories you're in the last few days I think that must have been quite horrible to two to go to that kind of experience I just can't imagine but you know I think a lot has to change in Canada and I know for Freedom 80 people lot has to change and only there has to be recognition and respect of our of our nation hood are people Hood the fact that we are Aboriginal people are rights have to be respected you know when I don't feel entirely comfortable talking about that because I don't know if this is the time and the place but those opportunities to talk about those experiences to talk about these issues there are few and far between and and we need to speak out somewhere at some point you know if if if if there's going to be any kind of as I said valid Isaac validation and certainly Justice for our people I think it's wrong I think it's just terrible you know when when are we going to be able to move forward you know I didn't feel I didn't feel entirely comfortable even coming to this this old guy during the last few days you know I wasn't sure whether I should even show up this morning I had a lot of difficulty with that I still do but I hear someone at the meeting leadership was here yesterday and both from from the matey perspective and I I don't know I just think it just think somehow form 80 people in Canada something there has to be that recognition especially on the part of governments and on the part of everybody you know things have to change our experience has to be validated our nation has to be recognized our rights have to be recognized and there has to be Justice and I think one of the real danger is I think of people's perspectives on on this issue of residential schools are Aboriginal people and the experiences they've gone too I think there's a danger to put it into a historical perspective and say well this is something that happened in the past and it's all good and it's all hunky-dory today everything everybody's okay that's that's not the case I mean this whole thing is intergenerational these issues continue today to victimization continues today and also continue it tomorrow as well UNAM I think there has to be here you know remedi you know whenever I see an Aboriginal person with her 2-year First Nations or any wood Twitter I see it on TV or whatever I'm fortunate to experience whenever they do something good what you're at success it's something that makes me feel really good makes me feel really proud and I feel that way earlier this week I was here with my daughter Crystal migrating my four grandchildren and they receive their crazy money for the first time that was a very happy and a very proud moment for me and for my family but anyway I'm not going to really say too much more I think you are going to hers and all of those people who who brought this I made this event possible and I hi thank you for forgiven get a time and for including me in this process thank you
