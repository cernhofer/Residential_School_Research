good morning first of all I'm my name is Ralph Paul if I had a ball that last name Paul it's not our name where Danny people my dad was called anywhere you got me what's on when he got married his name was changed to George Bell when I started residential school in 1944 that's when my dad got the name Paul so in the shrubs our clan system it disrupts our relationship with all relatives because of all the name changes that my dad went to first I want to take lady to my right or setting about some of these structures within the hour Circle Liquors I have said in previous circles and I've been told that there's no time limit in any Circle that a person for me given the opportunity to express their views their opinions in a circle without being interrupted without being triggered by time so if we want to use a circle I think you should eradicate time limits because I think once you do that then you are not in control of the circle right now because I'm speaking in this circle I feel that I'm in control not anybody else cuz I don't think it's fair to me being talked in value of talking in circles like this that I should be looking at my time and and and saying and giving myself I'm running 5 minutes no it's not it's not respectful to the speaker whoever it may be in 1991 I went on stress leave for those of you that don't know me my main profession as a teacher I became a teacher in 1959 one of the first teachers in the province of Saskatchewan of Aboriginal descent and every 10 years it seems that I I go through this stress not one of the conditions of taking a stress today was that you must talk to a health mental health worker or a psychiatrist I didn't want to go to psychiatrist because I didn't think I was crazy yet so I went to mental health worker in Pine Falls Inn in Manitoba todos me. Said it that say you're from Manitoba I lived in Manitoba from 1972 Rat Rod up to now I'm still living in Manitoba even though I was born and raised in Saskatchewan no just Health worker started asking questions who are you arrive love what's your number and all that then after a while he asked me if I've been to a residential school list of 1991. Almost 22 years ago and I said yes and that's when I broke down crying I've never cried cuz I promised myself when I left residential school in 1950 54 that I would never cry again I would never ever Harden myself you know a lot of us to do that we heart and ourselves away because the emotional things that we were supposed to grow up with you don't show you don't show your weakness and if you show your weakness and somebody takes advantage of it so as a result of that you heart and yourself because in resolution school I cried many times because I got beat up or I got slap strap by nuns and Priests scolded and things like that so as a result of that you harden yourself out for that and a 1991 because previous to that I had started really thinking about what has happened to me when I was in residential school because up to that point I've always protected have always defended the residential school but that was the only thing I knew I was there from 1944 to 1954 R6 when I started I was 16 when I got out now those of you that are teachers or education people or so I called you know that between the ages of 6 and 16. Your formative years that's what you reform your personalities form in those years does a result of that my my thinking was that I have gone through the system and I think that I thought that was it you know that was the way it was so I never questioned I had taken on the white man's belief system their language their food or culture and everything that's why that's what they taught me and when I broke down in 1991 from that question I didn't know why I don't know why I broke down something what's up triggered because that's when I started crying I started weeping thinking about my residential school years in the ten years that I've been now to delve into what it was like from 1944 to 1954 I will have a book out but I'm hoping by the end of this year and this book will give you an idea from my perspective I don't that's my truth that's just what I remember these are stories from Beauvais Indian residential school I do not try Caprice 20 buddy about you know what happened here and what happened there I'll let people judge I'm writing it so that we can leave a legacy the legacy of the residential schools to the people in my home area I want them to remember that history what it was like there's nobody that are that are alive now went to what I went through in the 1944 tonight in 54 for those of you that are listening there I'm 74 years old though young person but I have a lot of thoughts in my head even though I tend to forget some because of my age sometimes I'll get up here thinking or something by the time I get there I forget what I went there for so. That's part of the aging process and that's what I went through so them death scene as I came down here from Winnipeg I live in Winnipeg now is reconciliation somebody talk about the truth because each of us have our own troops maybe he forgot some of you at or less than is maybe he's bullshiting as you know but to me that's the truth that's my trucks that's what I went through if you believe it's fine if you don't believe me to request where you're free to choose whether you believe or not but their reconciliation powered from 19 it's a 1959 when I became a teacher I taught the white children for four years that was in Southern Ontario in st. Thomas and Paris and then Meadowlake for 2 years song to say that I'm you know hate it the white people is an understatement for me because anger is another thing that we carry the residential school survivors were angry because we have no control herself everything that we are is has been in doubt on us by all the people that taught us when you are told that the lot of you already heard it so you know I repeated the indoctrination that we went through that that you as an average of four you gotta be a white man and I found out that if I try to be a white man the white man look down with me so am I could be yet I'm an anatomy they call you don't wish where do I fit in I speak by Tank I believe I dress I eat like a white man but my physical appearance indicate so the people that see me as just another Indian because now one of the things that I did as chief of my community I said in many meetings as Chief where they have fun with Alberta what are the things that I've always told them was that we internalized our own problems we talked about treaties and trade you sent it but it's always the same people that have original people why not the other ones we make treaties with them so in 1999 we started the curriculum about treaties in Saskatchewan I was very sad because I was the director of Education with mltc. That time so now at your knowing to Scotrun your must-read teacher treaties so I think I had a little bit of part to play in promoting our own way of life now in Reconciliation Park I did what lot of us did I don't know a lot of our Aboriginal male people I married a white first white woman now some Indian woman and a pass out what was wrong with it at all when I was going to have you ever even look at me so you know so I so have I buried a white girl see some Scottish girl from Cape Breton Island she said she's from Port Hawkesbury so she's on she's a teacher I married her I had met her know the cross and we've been together now this is 35 years we have two children or we've done very well my son such as a lawyer in Winnipeg my daughter's for Sean I just finish your first year law at University of British Columbia in Vancouver so in that sense I did very well in a family but you gotta remember you have to remember that I never grew up in a family I never grew up in the family
