oh hello I'm going through my name is Brenda Sanderson I'm a 70 or Survivor I want to Prince Albert residential school and I come from a large family my late mom and dad had 14 children so I'm the 13th one my late mom and dad had a really hard life I'm the reason why they sent us to residential schools as my late mom was very ill and my late dad had a how to farm and you wanted the best for all of us to be educated and the sad thing was that dumb I'm so glad that my late mom and dad never heard horror stories you know cuz it would have really broke my mom's heart I'm locked my my own family members have been sexually abusing me only played 3 times twice like I went to court just recently and I'm good I went to court recently and they refused me because it was off property and that's what really got me angry and how come the government isn't recognizing my plane when I was one of their product random yesterday I was really angry like I was okay like I've dealt with my issues for about 15 years I'ma have to deal with it because I have a son and being a victim arepa had to really deal with my inner pain and I've done it with him I've went to counseling with him and art therapy I help my late Brother Gary he died of AIDS like about four years ago and yesterday's really angry at me because um they had a scroll up here it was from Gordon's residential school and they had a name of my brother's pent-up perpetrator and I was telling the people they're not standing or no really upset and I said well what's the health people drink like you know sure this is a good thing to reunite residential people but why have a pedifilers name up on the scroll it's like praising him and I was really upset and I said my brother died because of him raping him and my brother told me lots of things what happened to him and I was so angry and upset you know and I wouldn't told those people I said you guys talked to take that down it said you know I'm glad I'm not I'm glad I'm not a violent person I thought I would have ripped that thing down like that was what really stood me up inside Lake Tahoe my family we've since my mom and dad died and they do too like we've come a long way here in our healing Journey like we have holes we will help please my Leapster passed away and she left 5 children she told me lots of things when she was in residential school how much she she grew hate inside of her you know she grew hate inside of her and she didn't want to have nothing to do with my family because that's what the supervisors done for her and I liked it we can talk to one another you know and she hated me she died like that and you know I'm really sad my sister she didn't have a chance should have a chance to help you come up with her issues she died with a broken heart her son died a couple of months ago from drinking and driving in those are the kind of effects that the government done to us and my own children like I'm open with them I told him what happened to me in residential school and I'm now when I type in I don't really share them how do I share with them what happened to me in school but I just help people like my Prof asked me why am I why am I getting into education and I said it because I went native kids to feel happy I don't want I want them to have a native figure to make them feel happy to me like I had a hard time forgiving my people to question a white teachers they really they really scarred me and my family I know I just wanted to know I just want to let people know that you know healing is it takes it takes a lot of it's a never-ending Elm Road answer me like when I was young I was 15 years old and when I want to take my life by my mom was alive then and she talked to me she had a good talk with me and I think it's my mom didn't talk to me I would have just ended my life you know I would have just took my own life and said okay that's it you know how to take my cold this and break it when I had my children hand all I want is the government to to 2 hour make more actions make more I'm making more aware that I don't think like them I know when we have these meetings like after cyan and all of that like there needs to be more done like yesterday I told my cousin said you don't burn the social workers you know where are the Chiefs in our leaders you know they're nowhere to be seen you know I said I'm opening up my wind here and there's resources in a city like I live here and talk to me but I feel sorry for the ones that have to go back the reserve in Oprah's there's really nothing for them you know there's the go back to 2 wondering where else what else should I do you know cuz I remember and I was denied both how to um I had to really dig deep and my issues I didn't know how much the pain with it affected my health and I wouldn't down my doctor told me if I didn't know if I was going to come over with my pain I was like I'd I had a cancer growth growing in me and I'd it was from Pain you know when I didn't know we have to deal with it. Too to imply and I didn't know how to cry because that's what residential put on me they taught us how to how to be an emotionless you know how to be a robot and I'm really glad like I just want to thank for my brother and my niece that are here with me um we've come a long way has a family like I said leave some we found we talk when we we take care of our needs to turn our our nephews now but yet the pain is still there it's still it's still love it's still really am the plecostomus car you know even though I'm I'm heading my fifties now I'm still angry and fine I'm I don't know if I'll ever forgive you know peoples debt forgiveness to this thing but I don't think it is you know it's just something that happens in your life and it's it's really hard to swallow no but I'm thing I thank God that I have my kids you know when I'm open with them and I just do my best and I just I just hope that dumb someday that I can forgive but it's just like I'm a big roll Roblox for me you know a shelter myself like I just go to school and come home I don't really not that I am unfriendly or anything like that it's just I just don't want to meet new people and have them hurt me and I did it it's really um my emotions are like really sensitive you know but in doing so
