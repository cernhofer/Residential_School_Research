thank you I just wanted to share a little bit here I also sent the people that's been here and for you being here it's a big support to all of us sitting in the middle here thank you for being here everyone I didn't say that I went to school earlier but I went to return to school in Churchill Manitoba and I always think Manitoba for taking kids from Keewatin Island in Northern Quebec that's what I went to school in Churchill Manitoba first time when I saw these trees they bothered me because I can see the ocean because they were blocking it but I learned that after having to be seeing that and there were not very big trees but but anyway I wanted to share that we had a very very good school and it was strictly run by government not by Churches so we are also teenagers when we went I'm not minimizing anybody that had a difficulty in school but it was still far away for from our home so if if there was any bowling happening we believe our supervisors because we would blame them every time I have to school you go back to the dorm and they would be standing there giving up the mail letters from home and if I didn't get a letter from home I blamed her that way we were sort of bullying a supervisor sometimes we don't always listen we were like 15 16 17 year old and a whole lot I was in there but to me it was very good school I'm very grateful that we had that's cool some of the people that I went to school with talk about that we were not supposed to read we were stuff from speaking in Dota 2 and I didn't hear that I never heard anybody telling me not to speaking up to 2 so wait we also will always spoken up to church but one thing that was there that was very different was we would line up to go to the dining room before we get there we would smell something that didn't smell very good we were brought up eating see your meat fish Kerrville water polar bear Arctic sure that was her that's her to do with it that still today but it was very different from what my mother would be a hurricane and was CEO make maybe these people from sosten know how to cook head but it's not really bad and we can eat them and but later on there was a researcher came up to a hundred and this person interview many of us who went to that school and he told me that they have put something in this and where they were cooking the CEO made that would hurt your but it's not something different or bad today so that we won't be eating it anymore but I always say that in you are slow Learners we go back and read it all over again and we never learnt not to eat that and but the school was very good school to ask otherwise we are premier of Nunavut is from that school and I'm I got to be assistant Deputy Minister of Justice I'm from school this many examples like that who's going to that school who are the leaders today have known of it and so I just wanted to think that's cool and people from Manitoba John Mayer and for taking a to allow us to be there to go to school and so I wanted to share that with you we weren't very good things from them and we learn how to run for an office like student count so we had to campaign in a tub made my social studies teacher talk to me when you're right we're not right thing my speech and at the bottom he said be right B pray for me and I never forgot that whenever and for MLA in Nunavut and I used I did it worked again so thank you very much for for listening to us and I thank you for sharing your experiences all of you thank you mr.
