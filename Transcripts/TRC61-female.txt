took my life away I have to give my children up because you'll be scared there's no church in this area we'll stay with it think of my children are safe I hated what they did when I was bad I had to go in the in the women's bathroom and left the bar with the tooth brush my teeth with it now you other people looking to learn what we really want to we lived in hell who was the new school Lynwood jail remember how about freedom but now we have our freedom we can talk our own language again but let them hold you down stand up well. Walking show them that you can do it this comes from my heart because I never want to walk with my head down again never Zola how to say thank you
