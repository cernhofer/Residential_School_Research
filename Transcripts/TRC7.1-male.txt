All My Exes Live in I'm having a flashback good morning everybody I'm Roger and I'm an alcoholic I really enjoyed listening to everybody in them and I really brings back summer Pleasanton probably unpleasant memories I was at my cousin thought it there when she was talking about asking me about have ever been tracking the scrub floor in our basement the first thing that triggered was well we never had a basement I just told Scott that we were raising so I guess I have to answer that truthfully listening to what I've heard so far in my house at home there with my my family we do a lot of sharing especially around supper time that way we were raised that though growing up a lot of our communication was around supper table then though but my kids really enjoy listening to me hear the stories of the things that I've done the experiences that I've had you yeah they call me the Forrest Gump of Mississauga cuz it seems like all of any historical event that ever happened I seem to be in that picture I was in California in 68 during the hippie era then and I live in Chicago during the Democratic Convention riots I was right in the middle of their room I love Woodstock when that happened I was on my way over there opportunity to meet John Lennon and drink tequila with Janis Joplin and it just seems like this whole my whole life it's been focused on not being in the right or wrong place at any time so my kids really enjoy listening to those stories over my journey and then I seen that identify with a lot of people that that's soul-searching of finding out who we are learning our identity of the it's all part of house I guess that's one thing in common that we that we all have is that let's search for Who We Are know whether we find it or not to me it's not really important finding that P so I can be ready to enter. Western go away so it so it's a whole lifetime experience and dumb but I've had a lot of good good times and bad on that journey of soul-searching there's a lot of good things as negative the pain that comes with it but I think and balancing it out I like probably it had more fun searching for the good things sitting with the elders and go time to find out the what-ifs I guess I remember a charity earlier this morning about us about Spanish women you know would possess our elders and our community to send this to what was the real what was I don't know my parents I know they both love me Indianapolis able to care for us we weren't that we were in for a sense of not having a home food on our table we never had money I don't recall our parents me having me Rich but at least we had lots of love and our home and it was a lot of carrying those always lots of food on our table and the little doll with the exception of drinking a lot of that kind of balances itself out wake up Christmas morning and wondering if the trees going to be up or down or who sleeping under the tree let you know when we have our family get-togethers we always have to really good a lot of we see lot of humor in that I'm very fortunate I come from a little after what happened waking up on the stove skipped over big fight night before and my family so we were we were dysfunctional we were having fun but then I remember a number of years ago I was on visiting with the elders and I sleep with the owners in my community and I feel very gifted and honored to be a part of that Circle and to me it's a real big milestone in my life to be able to have that privilege of just sitting there with the elders and being part of group it's a hard part of my life to accept because I still Roger six years old that's always been a part of my life and I'll just took me under their wing and help nurture me give me to a level of them some sort of balance but it's okay but I really feel on it when I sit with them and I I never feel that I have them I have to hold back on asking questions with them I always put some really challenging questions in their way and one of the questions was what what was going on in my community and our family home residential school how could you people take that position and send us away what was what was going on in July last if you care for it and a very very honest with me I really I really acknowledge that now that the honesty that the elders have is it around that time and in my community it was all a lot of them if you use the term dysfunction does lot of alcohol and a lot of alcoholism doors a lot of them sexual abuse going on those lot of inter family relationships even with between brothers and sisters cousins and their children before it was an error on their Community where it was really it was really really bad and that's why the elders at the time they said these kids here they're going to get their things happening we did we want to protect them so that's how we got into some of us got into rather than to school because the elders got together and they wanted to protect us so they sent us out the resume to school hoping that would give us a little better of a life I'm also give us the opportunity to meet other persons like male and female and who are not our cousins or brothers or sisters who can have some type of the future so that was one of the purpose of intentions of the elders and when they told me that I was happy I was comfortable because that's part of our history it's not a happy part but it's part of our history and I was willing to accept that I really felt good when they sat down but when I told him what happened to me the physical or sexual emotional they were devastated my goodness that's not what I mean Asian came around you coming around a special I was I remember my mother you know Jason just like man down to drive we would have room what the hex going on and I didn't know the years of soul-searching and talking about what happened that time and I found out that it was meeting a chick that came to my house and tell my mother that I be stupid myself and my sister I was six and that she was eight they said they're going to residential school orders and be put up for adoption can you imagine that so fair with my mother with the broom chasing them down the road but we went to residential school that phone I didn't find out laws in my mid-twenties Steptoe how about that part of my life where I'm at just musician there you told me a ride you said you know your alms my brother the way I said that years ago are you and your sister are family will adopt you Vanessa family from she said to me right and I still remember your name Rodney Rodney lot for the musician too he said yes and we're going to adopt you guys and he was about my age so I still searching I found out that was around the time that my mother had chase this engine agent found the road with a broom through mouth so all those things understanding that connection that the what was going on during that time how much power that the Indian agent had if I have energy go to just go in and tell the family we're taking your kids you know that's jealousy you know what's really ironic when I do my disclosure it was right around the time that my son was six years old my daughter was eight and that really truly truly I was off work for 2 years and I told my wife I said anything that somebody coming into our house and saying those two are going to make it after school I was powerful spirit that we have to go through so the things that happened during that time it's just devastating in our communities that the Indian agent had that much power do that stuff and the fear that those people had in our communities and they still you know you called multi-generational effect we still have people in our community. Have that fear when are we going to learn to overcome that fear aisin on Council now this is my second term in though Let It Go world and I was telling her community when are we going to learn to overcome that fear of that you know we can operate without Indian Affairs that fear still there even are our front-line workers
