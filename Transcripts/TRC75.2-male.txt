so lot of the problems that I think we've developed after we left that place we were actually I guess times we were given to think which was probably before we went to bed when we think about how we're going to fix this that's why I'm here today work at work feeling I agree with Bob the Next Generation you know if they're here but they are caring what we carry I know I got children here intergenerational things we talked about how does destruction with lady in house over there yesterday and they say all we got funding to help those people so what you're asking are they ever going to get a chance to speak with us here I said with us after the fact Norcross be here we have to involve them not only that my kids but their kids I think reality is hard to fit in when you listen to the politicians like Bob was talking about over there they didn't say anything about what and why they did that or what they were apologizing for I always speak on the word genocide genocide is the biggest word that happen how people died in those schools they died trying to get away from those schools their Spirit was dead when you left there we went that is about all you know when you think about it I always talk about my grand grandson who I raised for the time he was born he said University but a week now I was teaching but who the Creator is it wasn't the God babe they taught us about in those Catholic schools or any of those schools that we went to when they talked about it with all the things that they said we couldn't do they basically they've been taught us that was things and I really feeling better this system TRC know I might have started out as a good thing but the hottest start at our community level and stay there master rebuild auditions are people that you are children when I was sitting at that table when we wrote the resolution to create what we wanted I said Grassroots in those words enjoy was part of that come we are sitting there talking about what we were going to right now and it's sad that we we started failed you can go to any Community anytime you could see what's happening in our community that's where we've been our system is there system the band Thorne Indian axe system even if we're at we we've tried that the different systems a lot of times you look at it and the kids aren't even party there when they should be taught from the time like my grandmother took me away because I was the oldest boy in my bath family I don't know how many kids he had but every one of the boys oldest ones were taken and she talked them she sorta chose was going to do what was give me the management who is going to be the politician all these other things so I I got lots to say lightbulb you but you don't like the time that we talked about here I think would be better spent you could do it in our community so we could actually gain strength from our neighbors and our friends enemies are whoever we're going to call it in the system we run right now I don't know I've been talking about what had to be done but when you talk at this level here you're talking to the political stage that you have no place in a system that word was be trying to develop R-Truth not show it's what I call it here I thought I seen the things that are missing to get to our truth nard my truth is to help my family right from the smallest grandchild or great-grandchild of whoever they are right through to then so we can all hold hands and say we are all working together in a good way no thank you guys for a listening to what little I had to say what I really believe we have to work harder thank you Roberta Simpson Alex
