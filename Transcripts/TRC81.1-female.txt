can you hear me Elvis have this worried that I'm not going to be hurt my name is Louise Martin on from the slope with First Nations been at this little island across from Tofino BC I have roots from cloak with test with a headset alert Bay and I also European ancestry from buddy my grandmother's and I've been sober for 32 years and drug-free for that amount of time also I mean and it makes me happy to see that because I come from the same stories that all First Nations people have been talking about since we've been here and in Victoria that there's any the one in I don't know specifically but you know where everything is been and it's been really difficult for me to be speaking and I'm amazed that I can speak because of the horrific abuse that I suffered and it was like being in residential school because I was abused by a lot of my own people my parents used to drink a lot and they go to different reserves and I get abused there and I think that you're very much Elder for saying that they were thought to be pedophiles that's where it came from and it is I really love you for saying that I was kind of scared to see things today but you gave me the courage and strength to say thank you to me it is really really tough to two be resilient when you finish so abused by your own people right now I'm happy to be wearing this show because all my life I haven't been a cultural person and it's made me feel bad because I don't know how to dance my sisters and my brothers dance and thing thing I'm the second oldest in my family and I'm the one who doesn't then so used to seeing into cultural things but in the last well if I've done a lot of healing on myself in I have still hard time and I have been so touched by people that have spoken here in its in sweeping Europe became Wednesday in I've been shaking away and I have a real hard time and I can feel people's pee man understand what's happened and I would also like to say that I was real happy I was told one day by a teacher North Island College that it was we that kick-started the residential school healing naked see I'm from the new channels and I spoke with sexual abused in 1989 and November and maybe it's not true but he made me feel happy and I was able to speak more about sexual abuse since and he told me that then I've been told that a couple more times lady at University was telling me she was writing my speech to teach people at the University but what happened to you channeled people so anyway I actually had no voice at all in I've been learning since I've been healing to speak and I still have difficult time but a lot of different things have happened to me a lot of nice things like I quit drinking when I was 29 and I'll be 62 and May in a long time you know I was a shame to be native because people were always calling us dirty drunk and stupid Indians were good for nothing in ashamed and then I went to Round Lake treatment center and I love the people there I met people from all over the place a lot of native people and I went to sweat lodge I never done that before and I was real scared cuz I felt stupid because I never did anything cultural before but thank you to the people from Round Lake for sharing their sweat lodge with me and all the time only 30 years that I've been talking I've been things have been happening for me I'm on time was at home in my apartment and I had a real nice experience I was in my bedroom and I was walking towards my closet and all of a sudden it was like this tornado went through me in it came into me and I had total peace and that the first time I ever had a native neatest thing happened to me and I was just totally Blown Away by the total piece that I had and a fellow came to see me you was at Sundance and that's what it was in I never forgot it and I love that because it was native I started I started waking up then that is the first Native thing that happened to me so I appreciate that have an affinity for people that share their culture with other with other First Nations people I was really enjoying that were a music CDs where it means we're all one I don't know if I'm pronouncing it right but damn you it's not how you pronounce it I don't know if somebody said it was from I think alert Bay the number Keys people not sure I can't remember now but anyways so I know that I came here for a reason and I've been All Shook Up about coming here today and would like to explain to you that I'm a medium and I speak for and sisters and I had a lot of messages from her ancestors and I remember once I was told to say something's in the lady she came back at me at a meeting I went to tribal council meeting in she said to me you she said she was looking right at me and she said there's people in this room that are trying to make brownie points she said in I never tried to make any brownie points and I was real sad and I didn't feel like talking again but I realized that I was told what to say and the message from our ancestors is that they don't want treaties happening no more treaties and I was at my daughter's place about maybe 6 weeks ago she went to the University of Victoria and she had a book it was called Canada's Canada's Indians and I don't know for some reason I just picked up this book and there's a there's a chapter in there and I remember the one line I didn't want to read anymore all it said was the treaties haven't worked in the past and I added while treaties are working in the present because we were too
