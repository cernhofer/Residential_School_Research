to all their experiences they went through hardships they went through bad experiences and good experiences ask them about that because you're supposed to learn from also try and learn the language from try and learn their history they were people they were human beings before they became my parents and your grandparents learn about those remember that pass on those teachings that you hear from themand most importantly learn about the old values they have but my parents i-83 does gold because they have these old wonderful values of how we used to have to rely on each other to live to survive to thrive they have those past Valley and so it's up to my children to laugh also when are things for me to wait for me to survive and my children to survive is I look at it as my choice it's up to meet and Destroy destructive Cycles in my family I could continue drinking two to cope with past hurts but no I choose to live I choose to heal and I choose to and those Cycles that's my choice because now when I look forward I don't look forward to for me I look forward for generations of my family the way we used to look I think many of us have lost that ability to look at the impact of what we do in generations of our family and that's what now I look at any decision I make I think I had and I told my children that you have that power in you to change to effect positive change in your family we all have that power and it but it's up to you to make that choice what kind of Legacy do you want to leave and what kind of Life do you want generations of your family to have the biggest stem way I can actually use an example is imagine that first person in your family that took a drink of alcohol and got addicted to it what would have happened had they not chosen to do that so that's something that I'll let you think about but I was looking at how we feel because we're talking about Truth and Reconciliation and being intergenerational Survivor I'd like to really share what I've learned and some of the thoughts that I've had about healing and Reconciliation I think we must look to our relation that the four-legged the winged ones the insects to solve our problems you see they have similar we have always observe the behaviors and study their ways our answers lie there so for example an elder shared with me about wolves the teaching about wolves and how cohesive their family is as a virtual people a long time ago we used to look at the behaviors of animals they were important for us to learn about us I think sometimes we forget about our connectivity to one another as human beings but we're not only connected with each other but with all life on Earth can anyone think of one way that we're all connected to each other it's something you take for granted every day it's my breath everything breeds and we're all relying on each other in some way to keep Earth and life alive well connected and I think sometimes we all forget that and we all start to think about me and my little bubble I think sometimes we got to think bigger than that and revert to the old ways of thinking the other thing too I thought was the we must be as industrious and socially organized as the ant the end has a pretty amazing creature they protect each other especially the queen when something happens to the Colony they all band together and and fix things so I thought Beyond was a really good role model we also must look to the tree for our answers of Life roots is something that that helps the tree grow up knowing your yourself of identity who you are where you come from what what the beauties of your culture or how we're all related I think that's very important and also taking only what we need being balanced trying to be balanced emotionally physically spiritually and mentally is very important just like a wolf pack like if if they killed all of the Caribou what would produce later for them to eat okay and um I'm just going to quickly go through a just a couple things that I thought was very important I'm almost done our children need roles within their families and I think that is very important as we move forward with healing and Recreation reconciliation we need to take seriously our roles as parents we need to look at the eagle and the bear and the Wolf to remember how we should parent we need to teach our children to fly we need to look at our children as gifts because they are just as we are we need to change our or the way we think about each other and ourselves can I share one phone okay I'm just going to share this poem that I've I've written it's called the bird bird song past wrongs still hunting Soul Souls woman with a bruised face doesn't know her worth man with a bottle and an unlined drowning years of being a victim girl losing her soul to a small pill losing her soul to forget generations of pain pool of Hope only those able to cleanse themselves of paint red here moving on like smoke in a bubble waiting for the bubble of self birth to release the long tethered pain into the air of reconciliation and healing if only they could see how to get out of the me how to find the values of a long as long ago day that is Theirs to find along their way if only they could find the warrior that dwells inside the warrior who wants to be fed but his drowned beaten drugged stifled and killed instead do they hear the whispered prayers the one that go up in smoke to be carried to the Creator the songs that are sung and whispered and sung by their loved ones in Hope of a better day for the people that are suffering for that extended hand that will help them up when they have awaken from their painful Slumber do they hear the Children Cry ones who are here and those yet to be born heal our nation they cry so when they are born opportunity hope balance and Harmony will be their life strength and wisdom will once again nourish them if only they could find the warrior that dwells inside the warrior that wants to be fed to help the warriors on their way so we see and we sing the bird song make witch
