your loving she still did things for me in the morning so I like in all she put a blanket outside or what she's doing laundry and make bound I can make to you outside and give it to me in the car and when I came back from the dentist Legend how that no Mark was gone LL. Disappeared in and when I wanted to ask him something or other I didn't have the more answers it seems like they just gave up my dad oh my uncle you don't seem to have given up he wouldn't give the hugs the loves they wouldn't advise us on anything because I can understand you know the government to call. The word appearance the Guardians over communities over your children Amish communities and they lost of government that power when did the Declaration of forcing us to go to schools and forcing us to go to Pacha homes so I understand a little bit of that history now nothing I'm 64 year old man and I live to love that hardships butter today I'm I'm I'm okay I'm a little bit angry at what happened but no use staying angry we got to find Solutions or change things and one of those things is like my grandson and my son and my daughter-in-law I always tell him I love you I love you you know I care about you guys I always try to get some advice and if they don't listen I tried to explain in a different way I haven't touched any alcohol or drugs in the 91 2 years I don't remember something.. I have to do on my own I just by looking at myself but like again I said it earlier. I didn't get no care no I don't care attitude back on my command is no I love you know hugs I moved away from there and got married after that make two years after they're married we had a child with a little girl and now by the time he was two days before her birthday in November she passed away she got six in the morning I'm not in Boston and I remember at the fort down I walked into the hospital she stiffened up in my and I didn't know what to do I just kind of went numb Blackhawk I can talk to my sister just saw this happen she was with me. Remember bits and pieces where I remember taking her from the hospital and changing her myself I would love anybody to touch her I even got the cast of myself a little ball made Boston and made and put her in there and cured her my at my brother-in-law's car I wouldn't let anybody ride with me I carry the body myself and future Charter Xavier Cemetery last remember was I was throwing dirt into her casket in the ground and that was a black holder had for 8 years after that I never knew what happened I never knew where I was or what I was doing preachers on that last day over. Eight year that I lost I don't look up in jail at 28 days I remember seeing all going for my sister I'll tell her to get me a Buckskin jacket cuz I wanna on buckskin jackets I'm just excited and then I'm coming home in 20 days so one of the pastor in the Julia give me a phone my phone and number and I was I was lucky my sister never change your number I didn't realize I was gone for eight years I didn't know I was gone free chairs and now she never asked me nothing she just said what size and I'll make it right away and give me the address so I got the address and now 4 days before I was out. The shirt came in because I wore your shirt that she made really beautiful shirt and now I still have that shirt that was back in 1983 I was the last time I I had I said that my four last five years there that was my last year and now I want home visitor I got out the door of my car when I got your place and this lady came running across the street and she's my husband a message to Nowhere talking then no need to talk and I could look and see what she is talking but I didn't know she was talking to and now this woman came out from the same door and she said rosie come back here I'm talking so this woman can running cause bacteria ask my sister who's that woman she looked at messages to my wife that Blackout episode automatic that time for my daughter's death took me all the way back here and I didn't know I know she's so we get along good today she was back home and everyone back together but I guess what I'm saying there is the love that we had before I went to dental school and those kids things that we lost Rodney the situation with my daughter I want to back out because I believe that I was so traumatized by her death not only by her dad that because I didn't know how to respond I'll always love that one I'm lately your toes last so many years and probably about 19 years I didn't feel any of that because of the teachings of the residents to you know it was always do that you can't do that you can't do this at all and so there's nobody say I love you or show that we love each other so I lost them because of the schools and I was not able to give that to my daughter while she was living with us when she was a baby I knew she was my daughter but that's you know we get the carrier but I don't I never showed that to love the way I do this one here just dissed regeneration and my kids know my kids that I have with the samples and as you've all been cheated quite regularly like babies eyes change every single one of them to carry on them I love them tell my love you and I think that's the best thing that we have is the value we got her some of the money is not everything I'm very poor poor person an nnp realistically like it still got my old Roberts from 30 years ago kinda rip in the back and I wear moccasins but I love being that way the clothes that I wear no I have nothing like that into this Taqueria I buy them second-hand it's not.. I don't want and for them sometime but it's just that that's the way I like living I like being my cell just being me and I don't want to be like everybody else I don't want to be driving a car motor by going to be tutoring in the mix I tell my son does need a mechanic but that's the difference that we have not they have a choice because I have a choice as long as it's a good choice and I support them I love them and I love you all and all I really I really can't feel that we have these and I really can't feel that some of us were not or not what did the young man say here will River still here we're not done you know my language is Cree and I still speak three I thought I thought I thought I even got mad I even to a chargeback at the teachers and the nuns when they try to slap me or hit me with rulers or pointers but not Community loving that I used to have disappeared and I moved out younger I later on in my 7th relationship the seventh Wi-Fi app I had done still had no luck we'll have nobody nobody taught me about sport connection until the Lakota people stood up for me the Lakota people got up one of the elders about up and talk to me and asked me how I was feeling really asked me how I feel and just had his eyes pointed at me and that told me how do you feel tell me you are feeling okay and be honest with me in all and when that happened I use somebody cared I'm not pointing down I start for 1 to put the people that I followed your culture today I hold a ceremony older cultures and and I'm very honored that did give me that opportunity if it wasn't for them I don't know where I'd be my people had that opportunity to teach me the same things and I didn't I got it someplace else but it's not that I don't hate my community I still like you but it's very hard to go back there I can't even take my own teachings back there till 1 except them it's just money glitch thank you I'm at IKEA
