were years old when they took me the priests would round the septic in a blue van receipt in the van comes I told my granny my shop on I was raised by my parents cuz they're both alcoholics I was on given to my our great-grandmother I seen the van coming and I went I went running to the Granny Weeno State we know if they don't talk to my oil mcdick win some money but I still go ran up a tree atomica Peppa Pig thunder that treat you get down here right now we're going to take you back to the school and I refused to go and then all the sudden the origin of pecan my dad at that time said no you're not taking her mosquito they took my daughter pic and they put him in jail and they said he will be released when you get down off that tree and come with us I didn't want to see my dad in jail get your scene I come down the tree I went with the priest we get there and you're the first thing when I did have a some days we don't be such a little girls to medium girls would be with them large girls love to time should we come back Dateline up the basins and I you know we'd all be just what would your bugs thinking Depend and sometimes you know it was it was funny but sometimes if we had too many bugs you know we get hit because you good see you in a white pan out and give Bug just hit that bad and I there's one day my granny sent me with some beads she said get these beads the father has them Silent Running up there the door swing open there's weather me show he had a kid all I could see through the back they had to the kid I can't tell you if it was a boy or a girl he was bothering all I know is that kid I could hear them crying I hope I telling this that whoever it was if you need me to tell your story to go on I'm here I don't know who you are that's there for me and I remember father me show coming struck me on the side of the head drug me off at her room when those leather straps are both sick but 1 inch thick if I got a note to hit in that room repent you have sinned directed internet here he won't be able to do the money but all I wanted was because my friend sent me to get meat I don't know how long he repeatedly hit me with that belt before you drug me into the church and you force me to kneel and you said you repent your Center I couldn't remember what I had done to wrong but I kept praying because when I thought I could relax and lay down because my knees are starting to get sore I didn't know he was watching me he hit me I never ate that day I was taken to the Reformatory my friend when did where was lots of times we don't kids got sick we never seen him again turn it up did the gates and want to see their kids we couldn't give him any answers some of them wonder where is my kid what did that kid wasn't there Moto X we need food and

Super 8 which not like potato like cut up potato and it was just brought that sometimes what we would eat lots of times when I would go home I wanted to go home and not come back but I didn't want my dad to be jailed again all through my years I kept thinking if I never say anything to anybody if I take this back to the Creator we agreed don't know but as an adult you you start to have kids you start remembering stuff you have triggers you're taking but you're passed by so many people you're forced to deal with things that you don't want to deal with their there my my life growing up with my grandparents was really good however the residential schools we're tough we did lots of stuff to to try and make it happen and we ended up getting the kids for it I think I was some of my friends that went to school with how they take up different stuff in their lives different religions I don't know if it's just a mask the pain that they're in or for them to just shoot themselves away from society some of them don't come home Amaya when I was done with residential schools 1971 they tear down that building ironically when I sat there and watched it go down it was my husband with a bulldozer that was bulldozing that's cool how I cried know how I thought but be as I don't have to share my story with anybody I don't have to say anything it's done with but you know it's not that easy things come up I'm human and sometimes my way of dealing with it hasn't been good I've been involved with drugs alcohol you know I didn't have much respect for myself although I was raised with respect but I lost it somewhere you know if I only have 2 kids I don't want kids I have my daughter behind me I've told her that that was something I didn't want my life with kids cuz I've been through hell and back and I was going to raise any kids so anybody could torment him to wait we were enough is enough if I could stop at that means that I could I wouldn't need to have any kids of my life but today I'm very grateful the Creator gave me two kids have a son who isn't here he's at home and I have my daughter behind me what's on struggles because of the way. I hit my kids the way I was treated I have pulled their hair I hope punched
