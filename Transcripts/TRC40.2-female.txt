I have dried blood I have been very Erin Shannon butcher when I raise my kids my son's an alcoholic is abusive and you know I remember growing up I didn't want to raise up a homosexual so many times I play with him and punch him and say you got to be tough enough to handle it I was raised to be tough I raised my son that way he's not going to be probably in the prison system though at what point do I take responsibility what point do I give it to him because as a child growing up I didn't bond with my mom I didn't with my parents have on it with nuns and Priests that were abusive so that's how I treat my kids my son is 23 my daughter behind me is going to be 20 I raised them with an iron fist that's something that I'm proud of not something I can read traktory do I could see if I was so worried to voice but they're struggling with that I know they hurt I've been with the same spot for the past 33 years if he was here he would tell you that I was a very abusive woman like I said I'm I'm not happy the way I am treated my post I just was so much when you thought growing up because my parents were really violent too abused me my spouse what course of life is take me to different different stuff where I have been forced to deal with certain stuff that come up where I work sometimes we take off positions and I went back thinking in my life I was in residential schools for seven years after that I tried to live with my father who is an alcoholic I was lost to the over to Ministry and I was placed and 13th foster home in those homes I was physically abused sexually abused I went to court for that rape and only to know that there are predators out there that you think you can trust and they're there they're working out I don't know how is a parent you can protect your own kids from predators such as the man that had raped me then left me naked on on the road and what Taskmaster they're wanting somebody to pick me up but what was I is the dirty little Indian kid don't be scared to stop on finding somebody did stop I have no clothes on you pick me up my foster home from there I said to myself after all of that going through all the tests of being a rape victim you have to I have to be driven to the high school by RCMP kids always I would wait what you would use so special about I don't go but today I'm riding in the car with special it wasn't for me I left them after 13 homes from one Province to another I so I've had enough I'm tired and you're 15 it went out my own I lived in Saskatoon in a tiny little room Winter High School try to forget about my past but it would cheating on me because of the kind of friends people that I hung I said somewhere along the line and I remember talking to an older he relates me that tomorrow I said you know if there's something I could do to change I would do it I didn't know what I wanted to do and then I realize that I was not only a big and a survivor of residential school but also a child in care Men at Work children across the country are so free and care so I went home to complete my degree in social work so I do that kind of work now I see kids and I see myself in them I work from my heart they say is social workers you have to work from here but pretty hard you have to work from here to preserve some of them don't have parents some of them don't what their family to their they're not wanted and these are kids that week we take care of so I've been doing that for the last so many years oh my my mission statement is that Wendy's kids are silent when nobody wants to hear them as a child growing up and so many homes I said when I grow up I want to be that voice Brittany children but you know it's just stuff I meant We Wish Justin of being our stuff come on tonight would give much to dance as well but when would they need gun it's hard not knowing what your future will hold your kids when you let them go in the way I feel I have both my kids with me on my son his try to have relationships but they didn't work so I have both my children living with me and I can live with me until the Creator calls me home I don't know I'm selfish I don't want them to go away from me because I was pushed away so many times for my own family my mother died of an alcohol disease or suffer for 14 years until she was called home remember my daughter behind me we're sitting there waiting for her to see somebody suffer like that and I didn't really know her I knew of her I tried to get to know her in the last 10 maybe 14 years of her life but that's not even enough to know who your parent do some of us are fortunate to have our parents all her life to know them in that capacity I didn't that's why I said I would always be there for my kids but in some ways I wasn't there for them Genoa I didn't know if I could do this coming here because I just felt I was asking a lady well I wanted to go to a session to hear other people story well however the miscommunication is I am here sharing my story with you folks I believe that sometimes things turn out for a reason and this must be one and I'll take your for that I just think every each and every one of you for listening I ask that you pray for all the children first and foremost the children that were affected by residential schools and the children who are still in care cuz I just another transition from residential schools is keeping them in in care and not being with their families also like to thank my supporters behind me I've had a lot of work but there's still a lot of stuff that I feel indirectly for kids I see that I work with and it's it's for them that I work for not for myself I just think the Creator each and every day I wake up and I see the sun I see it on the greatness of life and he hasn't called me home my work is not yet done I thought I'd like to thank you all I had asked my mom about you
