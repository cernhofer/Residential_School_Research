so then we don't want to hear also that arise with a small girls medium big girls big girls wear the grey 12 grade 9 10 11 and 12 and the medium girls worry about the grade 6 2 grade 8 and then the little ones where that little ones that just arrived in to school up to a book grade 4there's a lot of punishment especially against you in our classrooms but they were little we weren't taught the way that we should have been talked especially now that you know I come to realize that we have to do homework everything was on the board for us everything was on the board for us and they talk to her teacher and then we expect this to have everything right but you know it was nothing really show me how to do it after the mouth is one of the most difficult things that I re I struggled with in school and I suffered a lot of punishment from it I was really cool that you lot of front of my street light other students Salata times at night time I go to bed and not be scared to get up minutes morning because I knew I hated that lost tons of weight but I know I couldn't because I see my sister and when I seen her brought back with four other friends and we have to sit marcher slipped in front of us is in a bit playroom and sister said Presley father Our Father belittle said to her this is what will happen to you if you tried to do with your sisters or you do decided to go to run this is what's going to happen to you so we saw him being punished I seen her throwing up the atom smoke even though I don't smoke I don't smoke and with my little sister I don't know where she went all honestly I don't know where she went to school in her little ears and then I thinking about 1962 we got a letter this is a ridiculous thing that happened 1962 we got a letter from Indian Affairs connected to my parents your children are no longer accepted at the president's the school or Cal residential school because you are not never know they moved from the reserve the car thing you are not real children are not welcome back and I thought I was scared I was really scared to leave because that's all I knew I was really scared I didn't know what was going to happen I didn't know where were so anyway I told my mom you know the stickers back and she said you can get this letter so we read the letter it said they're not and you if I knew anything was going to become about it I would have kept that letter but who would know we were great 10 students grade 10 and that's all you know what I thought didn't say nothing so controlled by anybody can Fair don't know so it is pretty scary so my sister and I were the first two Indian girls to go to work at the high school and one of the most embarrassing thing was because we had to unassign meant you had to find out something from the directory so we both we went home and I said to her the rain what are we going to tell what everybody tell Professor Hebert it was her teacher and that was great and oh my God she said I don't know she said I'm too embarrassed and I said no need me to I said I want to do so anyway I was always the movie one and you know what I thought was that Grand Theft Auto all day we waited you know and she's waiting for answers from us she said well he little girls with your homework to do it it's pretty hard for the other I was pretty ashamed that I didn't know how to direct for us so do we have to school we waited together and if you want we could talk and we talked to you and she was very happy with her so we told her that we did have a telephone and we didn't have a telephone we didn't have a we didn't order directly was so you doing it so we found a short time when it was done I told her we didn't phones in the boarding schools didn't teach you some things and she says well it's not my fault since we would have to learn how to use your telephone while we did have a telephone we were so poor we grew up there to room Shack that's what we grew up in you know in and it was very shameful you know that's my dad drink a lot too and I was embarrassed to bring my friend's home if they came with just sit outside New York because I didn't want I didn't know anything it's not beer bottles hanging around outside adjust the feeling of Oz and you were so it will be it will be talk to me and I'm so that's the way and my mother when my mother and my grandparents and great-grandparents went to boarding school so my mom was a real was brought up real strong Catholic his you know and she was Miki Sushi what it is her time for us to be living with her she's pretty hard and I should always say what the hell did you learn in school anyways you said sisters missing something and you're always praying like we did every day and there's enough for school too pretty of a day we did everything end in stan estructura wake up we did laundry on Mondays everything was like we didn't to boarding school and I didn't realize it was coming from her because she was in a boarding school and she's getting her Tweety taught us about sexuality was so confusing to end up when you're ready to go home did tell us oh yeah you know you don't go you know all around next meeting up with the boys and because you don't want to get pregnant Elizabeth peaches and I continued that every night I go to bed nothing funeral Jesus the devil's going to be coming soon so anyway it was a very terrible experience of even with two marriages I had we're very bad you know when my husband's both went to residential schools and you know because I was going to be marrying all these guys went to residential schools they should be able to have a great marriage is well the first one was very very abusive you know when I know my first husband was touched by the way things happened and my second husband you know we're just starting to understand I want to share with you was really important but you know I see how this truck for the day. It's ready to blow away from me with my children my children are brought up with their grandmother I was to give up a baby because I was told that you know you don't go around saving the family like this and the priests and our community and those LOL for worker I didn't know how to reach I wouldn't know how to read the child if it's going to be better off there so far everyday I wake up and wonder how my children were that I'm separated from but I never gave up I begin journey 35 years old you know what my mama told me be proud of who you are be proud of.
