these two have them girls in the same room that sit in a corner and these to be giggling in the corner and talking about religion and teaching the young girls how to say prayers and end of a knot in it and then I was wondering where the girls were giggling in the front because the girl with the big girls that were in the corner we're sitting there and they were feeling the group young girls so they were taught how to abused each other and that's go and you know that is another thinking of you you know you know Define sexual abuse you know you see it everyday you know what's happening and then I'm it's just there all the time and the unfortunately end it's just not a good place to be and being told by one of the one of the nuns that you know they're there supposed to be at the holy in all that they've gone through all their training and everything to be such a holy person then they're closer to God than you that's what I that's what I thought anyway and here they're telling me that because I didn't put the Apple in the right place on the on the table that I was stupid and I was not worth being taught any way I can teach you anything so you're not be what you're not worth teaching anyway cuz you're going to be a sloth on the street and the lucky thing I didn't believe her I didn't it didn't sink in here or here Dickinson I've been a success in my community and so I've got to defeat at them they didn't put me down low enough to arm Keep Me Down I survived and I'm I've been a contributing woman in my community I have not set back and let everything push me down I have been strong enough to stand up and be the best mother that I could be because I didn't have any training other than my brothers and sisters but I didn't have that continuous teaching from my parents my grandparents my aunts and uncles because I was taking away from them in the they refused to teach me the language for I went to school because they knew that if I talk my language what up what was going to happen I was going to be slapped around or with the status test stand in the corner and be told that I did something wrong again and um it's just them it's just been continuous Sun beating down beaten down and that's cool but them I must have the best Guardian Spirits in in on Earth or in heaven because I am not where they said I was going to be I am I am I am a survivor and I'm here and I'm working towards getting that over and done with with my my children and my grandchildren and now my great-grandchildren so I have still another purpose for getting this work done now we've been working as a group for 33 years so I don't know since 1993 anyway we've been working and I it took us two years before we could even talk to each other about her experiences is it took me that long to really trust each other to tell our stories but we did and we got strong and we've been teaching all over not just to our community members what time because of what we were doing what we were quite famous people wanted to hear what with all we did it and how they could get their their bum circle's going and I'll get their Elders strong so we've been traveling you know up and down PC and we've been recorded so many times that we have fun I heard that we have a film or something down in Hollywood in California and then statesiders universities down there they're using our faces down there and then I guess we're quite famous and I didn't even know it so we've been working up quite hard with our our stories and and trying to help as many people as we can but the most important people now or my family my my my children and their children and their their children I just have that hope that though with all of this work that's being done now my biggest and most powerful prayer in the world that's been answered because this is happening today and then I hope it continues that you know something good is going to come I know something good is going to come from it because I'm already I'm already speaking and then people are listening actually listening and hearing what we're saying they're not sitting back and listening and doing okay they're listening and they're saying okay what can we do to help so the hands are out now not enough not to hit you but they're out there to shake your hand and give you a hand to get up from where you are and and be a better person and I'm hoping that the this continues now and that we're going to be healthy and strong mentally physically and spiritually we have to get over the fact that the Catholic church is what I was within that that the church is not the not the one who beat me or break me or you don't get everything they are the ones that the people that were in the schools that's the ones that I have to blame not sure so I'm not here Church bashing so that's what I've been accused of a couple of times but I know now that they're not they're trying to teach you something the people that they sent to do the job didn't know how to do it and they were bad people so where I'm still working with that but I think I'm there now that I'm strong enough I can deal with it I don't discriminate against any religion or anybody I think that time the large the great spirit put all all all colors into Hazel into this world like a beautiful garden and then we are all from the same same Mother Earth doesn't matter what color you are your own brothers and sisters and I just want to keep it that way that any color in your garden is beautiful so welcome everyone and I think that's what I'll all I have to say
