my name is Fred I like I attended residential school in Saint Marys and the new Mission and Campbell I guess I thought I might as well say captured when I was 9 years old Asian route to Residence after Christmas and it was a big experience for me because I came from our village were going away in and it was by horseback and we had to go to the ferry and I lord of the the people that came from I reserved a they were forced to go to the residential school because the Indian Act I know I don't know if you guys know the history of that I it had sections in there though we're taking out gradually over time and you had to attend school you if you didn't attend school you are considered a delinquent I think there was one line or one payment of the old Indian Act and if their parents didn't send you there than they were they were liable to go to jail or whatever my father didn't want me to go there so because he got away my sister had started going to school and couch and she wasn't great 5 nice nails capture I think about two years later my mom got Damien all all our family ended up with admission by my brother what's two and a half when you haven't even sent there it was a family at that time but it was about seven or eight of us and the top bigger with we all when she ended up at the residential schools experience I want to talk about it is basically what they try to do to you there my mother had taught me how to do math help on everything before I got there but she was raised in the residential school from the time she was a little baby will keep her mother died when she was born and she spent the next 16 years in the residential school I think that experience door. Enable our family to survive often the Wilderness iconic wear we went to town maybe one once or twice a year baguette Bare Necessities like sugar and coffee or some the rest we we we grew or hunted or we did all our own food better own Flour Mill wheat grown weak and stuff but when the irrigation system broke broke up then we had to move my father had to sell his stock you know I consider them all off because he had you don't nearly two hundred head of just about anything then we moved it was that was funny experiences started we all ended up in the residential school and remember the first week especially in Mission first table gave on my first cousin when we went there was feed the pigs yeah this big cartoon Bobcat behind the kitchen and pick it up and you bring it up and feed the pigs the only thing they didn't know what that come from a rodeo family and every time we Apple finish Vietnamese Rivals Pizza and we go to class but we smell really awful so they ship is over to the principal and then we have to go take a shower and change your clothes going on maybe three days then they took those off their will so they said we'll put you in a place where you can't get in trouble of your shovel the manure out of the barn but by the second day we were riding those calls and we're coming out of that barn and they got sour milk so that was the end of our work I guess wait wait we haven't kneel down in front of the Blessed Virgin Mary for about 2-3 months big statue I don't think about it you know that they wanted to break your spirit it didn't matter how happy you wanted to be or try to live and I but I made my mind that they weren't going to do that to me every time I heard a train it reminded me a home but I seen how those people were punished when they were when they ran away that experience along with enough to make you afraid to run away because I seen them really beaten badly and better take their pants down and stop in front of all the students but I wouldn't cooperate I learnt their Sports and everything really well when he asked me to play for the school came and went I wouldn't pay for them so they punished me I have to get a toothbrush and grab the little squares in in the bathroom while the games are going on at the school and so I did that I wouldn't think I was a good athlete but I wouldn't play I want to text you I got sent to Hamilton we got the cameras and we played first thing they ask if we know how to play soccer basketball and so we told we could it Uno 13th Ave wake me in with the men's league in Stockton then the basketball as long as you're good at you you are treated a little different than the rest I sort of learned that after I learned that for Missions experience there I know a lot of the day the good feelings that I had there were probably in my sports page but at the same time admission is where things happen to me that was the only place the sexual abuse and things like that happen
