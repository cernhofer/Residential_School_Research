Crystal Miami Dakota send one from care of the cattle it's good to be here and thank you for allowing me to be here and for your words why I went to residential school in and now lebreton Maryville when they first started having actually went when the apology first happened I went I went to go on my dad my relatives because I they are to leave the sauna service what's up with a broken spirit and yes that does affect me because I'm timer my journey is mainly been intergenerational trauma that I've faced my place today where you know you have her tonight so it was going to hurt you feeling is everything and I'm understanding that deeper everyday I come from a place that's was broke my circle was broken it was interrupted I want to say it's broken it was interrupted in my eye I can't speak for my siblings on my family and I don't have that right too so I need to be kind of General about some things here and you know I come from incest and it took me years and years and years to even say the word it took me years nearest nearest even understand that word I'm still trying to understand it but most importantly in my journey today I I believe in healing why do for myself know that and believe that everything that happened in my my life and my passes is for reasons and again I'm beginning to understand something them even know it's really really painful two part of my healing I do today is as I write I'm alright tonight and I spend time with my family on I have many rules in my life I'm I'm a mom I'm a grandmother I'm at you started being I'm a helper I'm a teacher and I on a roll of those rolls today and I'm so grateful. That I'm able to find that and myself and I look forward to you know each day I'm giving kind of ironic and what I've heard at the from many people that I have to go into a system of Education today that to learn my history and when I first learnt my history especially residential school because my dad didn't talk about it and before he left this world he he started talking very little about its hands shortly you don't want it so what I want to she wanted to back to visitation systems to go work on my degree I began to learn more about the residential school then because it was started to come up more and for friends him and like I say it was quite ironic that we have to go back to that education system Western World take to learn this but in spite of that I'm grateful it was really angry for a long time in my life and when I have to relearn this I was even more angry and I didn't know who to be angry there was so many people I find it amazing I was able to finish my degree because I'm so angry when I began to really understand the impact and the intergenerational impacts of residential school because many of us you know we still see if we live in it and it's really important to keep learning about it though to listen to the people the ones who went before us and the ones sorry to generational survivors it's so important to honor the words I want to listen to the older people like I saw one other words and I'm so grateful that they're breathing and that they share their pain because it is healing and they give me hope and I'll come to you do these kind of gatherings because I come like I said to all tomorrow my dad my relatives who suffered so much sure but we're never able to heal I icon for myself I come from my children and my grandchildren to continue healing and breaking the Cycles in my family and it's not easy but it's something that I believe with all my being that it's it's also guess that's within a stain on my white paint as his sub also been my healing and it will continue to be I've been really emotional last few days because I always feel my helpers with me I always feel my well with his with me cuz I pray for them especially when events like this happen I come from my brothers as well because I have older brothers that so are still really suffering the effects of of our life and it's been very difficult for them I know a large part of it is how we as a society continue to tell her man that it's okay to cry it is okay to cry am I under the Menace but she would come to her to heal because you get me home because I suffer with frustration and anger that that's so my family still suffering I have a brother who's very close to me and he ran from our pain and never came back and we haven't seen him for over 20 years and he's like he's like my soulmate so why I pray for you everyday he's still out of service but you know it's not paying this is not breed that Robin has been I think that you know whenever I'm around circles and ceremonies in Linda the work I do is so so social workers well it's It's Been Working Families it's them again against me hope because I do believe in healing I believe that like I said I believe my everything that I've experienced was was meant to be even if it's things that are very you know shameful and painful I've learnt to to understand myself have learned to love myself and I'm grateful
