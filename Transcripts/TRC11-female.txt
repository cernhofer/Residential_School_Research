unofficial Siskel of an equation across image, Cordova I'm very interesting for a long time since I've been in this insurance Circle in this format and then it's amazing how even though I've never been to residential school how I can still relate to so many of the things that we talked about playpen or search for healing search for identity grandfather was part of the enfranchisement in good as The Story Goes today in my family system comes from the family that kept the great secrets and so the story still unclear so still seeking a lot of the truth that from our family systems so but then I think that's my grandfather's purpose maybe was to make sure that his children didn't have to go through what he went through it's okay make sure that he married and not need a woman and then he was so strict to my mother then my mother will get too dark in the summer time and she would be isolated in the home and beat me because can return to them this is a lot of the story of a lot of mixed blood people we don't we don't know where we fit and I was also married a very young and dumb if I myself am at the age of 37 years old out of a 20-year marriage and them in a treatment center or after the treatment center in and we're good for recovering drug addicts 20 years and up and not knowing who I was there what kind of music I like your will my faith with my favorite foods were all of these thinking they were teenagers and they were going to come and live with their mom who's there clean and sober he wanted to have their fun too and so they chose to live with their dad search for myself completely alone and then I started on the ceiling and like it's been mentioned I had a lot of years where I could remember I couldn't remember from the age of freedom infamy it was good also very important for me to understand what had happened and I knew would have happened because I wasn't the only one and I found a system that this had happened to the only reason that you're so grateful that I'm here today and sharing about this is that I really worked hard at them dealing with it sexual abuse and secret that happened in inter-family system and how that in itself was a multi-generational event that happened from my grandmother to my mother to myself and I had felt very proud in my lifetime that done the circle was broken and I believe that to my children were sexually abused and then none of my nieces there none of my neck India so proud I feel proud that they given up on drugs no alcohol I feel proud that I picked up the Red Road and starting to know about myself and went on the healing journey I feel proud that at the age of 43 went back to University Union go to DSW and social work and worked with people and work for Native agency in touch with a lot of people quit going to residential school very young pro that I was done became the woman I was meant to be this week beginning of the weekend I found out that my brother you just get work 777 children and my youngest disclosed that he's been sexually abusing my niece through it sent me into this some rage long time since then I swear I've been that angry the grateful that I've done the work that I've done and that I have the resources today that I can turn to somebody under a good friend called me and I was telling her that I was saying I'm going to be okay and I know that I feel much better I ended up having to him right away it manifested itself in the physical physical ailments red walking back to physical pain so I have a great chiropractor in that she also works on emotional stuff and I believe in that we can heal ourselves and so we could delete Liberty working is very first two days and right away that pain a dissipated and I started feeling good again but that my question today is I don't know this the same girl she was in Alberta I don't really know her that well I've only met her a couple of times last time I met her she was six now she's so probably 14 and I don't know do I tell her about the family history do I tell her that she's not alone do I tell her I want to tell her that she's going to be okay and don't let it affect 20 years of your life like it affected me for 20 years of my life insulin that's why I'm grateful to be exactly where you're supposed to be but isn't that the way it always happens that those people that I can share this with the people that I can talk to and I've already gotten feedback and one woman right away said don't tell her don't tell her about the family here we come from such a stage or a life of secrets.com when she said don't do it right away I'm wanted to do it even more and so I'm going to keep on talking to people over the weekend and Afraid now that's one of the most beautiful things that I'd like to do with recovery and in my healing journey is to pray and Trust in spirit and then the thing that time I like to do when they have been practicing for a few years and still need a lot of work in practicing is to have that quiet time and so bring is the asking him to the quiet time is it make yourself quite enough to receive those answers in the spirit guide me but I really do need to do before I love it and um maybe my brother and so I understand about the emotional Detachment that that people talked about that was very prevalent in my family system also and I don't want that to continue I'm very happy you got them all my children know about my history I didn't I it was it was the best thing the disclosure is the best thing once I just closed only once I had started my own journey and that I was able to do it without traumatizing to be careful sometimes and went Stone victim to Survivor today and want to be forever and I teach that guy that's part of who I am today but also am I'm so happy with the relationship that I have with that I have three children and my son and two daughters and one one of my daughters Walk This Way with me and so we always have that support I got scared this week I got scared that. I got scared for my new grandson I got scared for all my other nieces and nephews I got scared for communities and our nation that's your thing. So I want to make sure that I stand strong and I'm very happy to have this opportunity to discuss something that still pretty fresh and that but I don't want to say that there isn't any hope that I believe that there is great hope and now in our journey English
