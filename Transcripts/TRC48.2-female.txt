and not parent it took me to one long time to understand that you know and also as I got older I began to understand when I was born I can the late fifties when I was that was when our children now you know had couple Generations had been going to boarding school our communities were changing it was westward expansion there was a lot of things coming in you know and that in itself just upset societies and it was in the fifties that alcohol was allowed in our communities in the reserves and to me that some of the most damage not just a boarding school but when alcohol was allowed I was a little girl when I seen stuff we're now we would have been apprehended if there was agencies around all the adults were drunk all kids week we were left out in the perpetrators were left open to anybody we were in trouble alternates were drunk you know and I still carry this Dimension my mind me and my cousin are the same age and he's in the spirit world now but women most secure sold and all the old people all the you know the address for passed out in a and he was six years old and he had to go feed the horses now you're still member that six years old he had a responsible going to get his horses and make sure they're watered like you member hit and looking so small taking those horses butt I remember how you just you had to learn to survive you know and I was also as I got older I began to see some stuff even their communities how are communities became very talkative very very toxic and they still are you know I worked in my community for when I went back I went to back to my community for about 15 years I work there and that was some of the worst experience if I had you done being a month working with my own people like you still see people being so needy just the lateral violence you know things we say to each other the way we treat each other in our communities MSU where comes from not going to blame the truth cuz you can but it comes from a distraction just the destruction of the family systems how we live how we grow up and how we treat each other but also Ohio I am excited my account in our community I seen a couple situations where we get new leadership be no people are in there at one point in time they fired both 6 people and this caused a lot of ruckus in our community and I've never seen and I was the time the residential school money came into our communities we start getting lots of money and I'm never seen such greed in my community Houston people you don't they have used the money that was supposed to go to survivors I seen I almost could see the priest in the nuns walking around in our communities I almost could you noticed just telling you these people how to behave you know but anyways it was a really rough time in my community it was very toxic and then I eventually had to leave my community and I'm I do shop protection I work in Alberta for the MHL Britain for the last 9 years I'm on a break right now but time you can see the family systems you know you could to see write down in the family you get to see you we have a long way to go and it still hurts me because I still see your children being lost to a similar system like the child welfare system and you know I work right in the system we're good minion people it is a good system but it's also one of the hardest things to get your children back from one system to get them out of the system and bringing home to their families and dab I don't know I had a lot of stuff prepared and Sunday I'm blank maybe I'm just try to lie or something it's a joke and I will tell I did go through the IEP process I remember one time I was leaving I was working for Star season 2 start of Calgary and up I wish I stopped and hobbema you know I'm stopping at stores in this guy give me some information about the IEP process so I get to Calgary and I called I called block and Associates so that at that time and that someone's ones there within a week take my statement it was really rough it was rough for me to do my statement I give a hot room I had to remember I had to go you know I had to remember the abuse that happened to me in boarding school and all the abuse probably took took place that first year when I was there when I was a student I suffered abuse at the hands of a priest while he was giving us catechism lessons and I have to really really relieved that and tell my story you know with the process and I remember them just that afternoon after you know I did my intake I got to stick my leg swelled up really bad really swelled up yeah and I took a while it took a while for you know the swelling to go down had to go see the doctor but I'm who did take away I think was about I didn't mind you know my intake is go to you 2 years later that I went in front of the you know I went to the IEP hearing but I was living and working up in Fort McMurray then and I and I need to tell you people if you're going to go through AARP process you have to have all your information as accurate as possible remember the days remember the times and has awful that it is I had to talk about the abuse at the hands of the priest during catechism lessons and and I remember the church the way she started crying listen to my story I think she seen seven year old girl you know how you go to school people who supposed to take care of you how they emotionally damaged you know the use religion they damage you in one of their over a man abuses you Edmond that was that was the sexual abuse but you know suffering I'm suffering abuse at the hands of nuns later that was in it sounds like you know it's almost like they just pound you and pound you and pound you tell me are you and I think that's why the commission lawyer was just crying she's crying and she said he know I heard so many stories she said if I hear so many stories not because I hear the worst she said it he said it hurt I guess it just hurts just as much but it didn't take me long to get my money I mean I got the first level of this is kind of funny when I look at it you know if you do well you know if you do really well with your life you go on you no longer on your you're no longer a victim you get less money but I did get level 1 but as you know I went to HighSchool I did fairly well I am didn't have any major major addictions I went to University and I held good paying jobs in RI but I still did get a settlement time it was only about 7 months later my process went fast but the priest who abused me was probably had the most victims of any of the rest of the schools in Canada he was there she was charged as pedophile like he had put if your charges on him so that made the process easier but just let you people know if you can remember the dates you can remember the times as much information process is faster it's easier and you know this is a tough process like all the healing it doesn't it doesn't happen all at once bits and pieces when I started admitting would really happen to you you know and there are like I also have good stories to tell if it's an outside but I remember the time just before my. The lawyer calls me you know and she said you have to talk about the abuse and such a really good details that you have to be able to but anyways I'll just tell this one last story and I had been in the park and I talked to her for a long time I had to been walking in the park that I go stomping home I was so mad because I relieving some of the abuse and then I went stomping home and I was just mad I was sending these white guys in the truck for calling me hey hey and I was thinking perverted was there was he said there is a bear running around be careful
