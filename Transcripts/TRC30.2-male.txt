guess I was confused I didn't know I didn't act upon it but what I did when I guess I did act on it and to convince myself I was a man that's part of the reason why I would I get abused girls or women abused in the sense that go out with them and then leave them just to sleep with them basically an end that was a lot of money on my life and and you know I feel. I apologize I didn't apologize directly but everyday when I say my prayers I apologize to those people that I'm hurt and you know I didn't realize that I would passing at this function on to other people as well and you know if I could reverse it today I would be more than happy to do that but I know you can't but I want to talk about it and and help and pray and and do those things and I hope will help those people so it's not as as I said when I begin to speak about it I knew that I became a Survivor then and as a Survivor you feel a sense of relief once I became a Survivor and I was able to start not so much comfortable at least some really some of that burden that I was carrying that weight was no gone and like I continue to lie to try and to try and straighten everything I will not everything but trying to deal with things a little bit at a time so some of the things that I did it I went to I going too fast and the reason why I went to pass now I first of all went to elders and offered money on protocol and I asked him how do I how do I do how do I start this how do I start this whole process and the elders told me that someone is first things that you need to do is you need to acknowledge your your spirit and usually back before the Europeans came the way that they did it was that there was a naming ceremony that happened and I know I can't have a naming ceremony I know I couldn't be reborn again and start over but I wanted to do that so I wanted to know what my gosh. Name was until I made the offerings and the Elder told me if you want to do it properly you have to sacrifice yourself then Anthony proof do I need greater and the grandfathers grandmothers that you're serious about this so I did I went to pass and on my fast. I am some good things happen to me and one of the things that happens after I spoke to you the pipe and say any songs with the Elder stormcloud Brewing right away but a big thunder clouds thunderstorm so and then in the morning after I'd fallen asleep later that night the morning I woke up it was very bright dinner so a little yellow bird on the wheel over there singing basically tripping towards me until I said a prayer and I told that little bird I don't understand you but maybe in the future I will then he landed on my on my cloth my Yellow Claw and two two weeks later after all of this went on I went to a nice large some people call it shake attend and I made my offerings there and I asked out there that that was there too to get my spirit name and now so it was happy so not be with my name and translated in English is yellow Thunderbird men and the Elder that came in it was quite powerful I'm basically there was some I sorta but I know there's a lot of people in that room and it and those that don't know it's a dark room there's nobody could hear noises but you don't really see anybody and all I saw was the start of the tunnel I couldn't see the Elder but I was like everything else was closed off I couldn't hear anything is very powerful any told me about the he told me about my past what happened he said that the Thunder beings were there for you that day that felt good to hear that actually so and then I said that little yellow bird that came to talk to you said you were selling your something to me and so so that that's why the name of yellow Thunderbird man and also told me other things you said that the Maya money colors are yellow and white and he said that the Thunderbird as my guide my spirit guide and all the birds all the birds are your helpers and those are the ones that are going to help you think you're going to see them around any said that your purpose on this Earth is to learn as much as you can and help people how people to doubt themselves so that's what I've been doing I've been facilitating off programs at the penitentiary for eight years now and and it's good I like it but I have to take care of myself at the same time so but it's interesting how I went back to the start to try and get myself healed I get to get to myself today that gold that I have of that purse teachers and it's to me it's working out I talked about my two sons I have another son right now that though I haven't seen and I was married and divorced again so I haven't seen him since she was eight years old he's nineteen now and it's basically one of those things where every time I have an agreement of visitation agreement which is not enforceable by the police is what they told me because reasonable notice can be anything it's what they said so thank you so so I haven't I haven't seen him in a long time I think about him a lot I was with him for the first eight years it's funny how it keeps coming around because I choose all that happened to me and then I haven't seen my son now since 8 years old so I'm hoping that'll work out I'm trying I'm praying as much as I can not to kill eventually let go of the anger and allow me to see my son or it may be well come and see me one of these days I hope for that so and end in 2000 and 2008 I was blessed again this time I know I have a daughter she's 3 years old today and I believe that the Creator gave me another chance at parenting and so I've tried the best I could it was interesting that when I first found out about the my daughter went when my wife Persephone know that she was pregnant it was Robin's that Nest it on the tree with a birch tree right in front of my deck and everyday I go out there and watch was Robbins from when they first came there when it first started building the nest and how hard they worked throughout that whole time from building a nest of eating those babies until those babies were able to fly on their own and you know what they were there to have to help me so it's good to be in today I can actually sit here and tell you that I'm sober I did not that I have let go of the drugs and alcohol I don't touch those things I don't want to touch them I don't need them anymore there were a negative coping that I used and it feels really good it feels really good and my daughter and raising her the best I can I pray everyday for that guidance and to me that's what I need to do is all of that time when I said I was a victim then I became a Survivor and then now I'm building up lots of knowledge why did knowledge is Hyundai a Seeker at this point but I've done some peacemaking as well have made peace with a lot of things are still things I need to make peace with and I'm very very happy so when I work with the guys at the at the penitentiary I make sure that they understand I don't tell them what to do I just give them the information and explain to them this is how would work for me hoping that they'll understand hoping that they will as well I'll begin the healing Journey walking not the walking that path that medicine wheel that was given to us and and that's what's going to help us that's what helped me and it's important that I continue to gather knowledge so I'm always listening with both ears when I hear people talking about their experience because your experience helps me to heal as well so that's part of the knowledge Seeker I listen to the others I speak Korean fortunate to keep my language my first language is my shift my second language is Cree so when I go to ceremony and it's slippery out there speaking I'm able to understand a lot of what they talked about and that's where I learned a lot of things and I'll continue to learn those things and I'll continue to make peace peace with things I would no longer be a victim and that's very important to me so thank you very much for listening to me and I hope that somebody out there listening will be able to take something from what I just said and use it for your own personal dealing with what was done to Aboriginal people was wrong that's that's the first thing we got to say to ourselves it was wrong and it's not the blame anybody I see a lot of anger getting people yes there is anger there and it's good to get it out but we don't blame we are not that kind of people and I don't think her Elders want us to be that kind of people I don't think the Creator wants us to be that kind of people so I could just share what I have with you and other people and and hope for a good life that I can achieve that goal when I first started my life from being born to a eight years old those good memories that I had that's my goal in my life and an awesome one I hate it.
