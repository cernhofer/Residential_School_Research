situation where there is love and affection and tenderness I never grew up like that I grew up in a very very impersonal surrounding atmosphere environment it was very impersonal and I tried to give me an idea of all the thinking that I did wide was so being married to a white girl I can't say I hate white people and I can't say that because when my wife is a white woman but what would you say if I said I hate you but we've got a long wait been together 35 years and all and wait we've done very well she's still teaching and for those of you that may be the first time that's why first profession as a teacher I became a teacher 1959 when it wasn't very popular for Aboriginal people to get into that profession so I called right after 95 and then I became superintendent of Education everyday my PC for eight years and then the last four years from 07 to 02 11 always chief of Patrick job done a lot in my time time my time is getting shorter but you know I'm still not the laying down my my pencils yet and I'm still going to go ahead no I just want to give you an idea of my perspective art for caregivers in the forties and fifties when I was a young child 66e the people that were delegated their fiduciary obligation was to look after us but the problem is if there is any runs out here or any religious people these people these nuns and Priests never had training family situations never they didn't know how to raise children they didn't know how to hook they didn't they couldn't go up to a young child and say Ernest I love you they couldn't do that because to them they're renounced at either one of their votes they renounce things under three of them that they took three vowels that they took and the three vowels are poverty these religious people owned nothing so they preach to us they told us that money is the root of all evil that if you want to make money then you're forgetting God the Blessed Virgin Mary and all over holy people that they believe in what does poverty put them in a situation where you cannot own anything the only thing you own is the clothes that that's given to you so they caught us there their rules of poverty then the next one is obedience that's another vowel they took you have to obey because they told her some cells all authority comes from God because that was there they're thinking so anybody in 42 the place of God and whatever they told her you did without question so in a sense they did that was in in school you over you don't argue if you argue you got a slap slap be questioning Authority so then they start they started punishment they rationalize and they the I said it's okay to hit a kid because God is on my side that type of thinking and I can tell you because of my personality because of my the way I am I got a lot of that slap strap physical physical punishment but the one that they really messes up parts in their Vive Chasity they renew that they renounce their own sexuality these people priest couldn't father children nuns couldn't couldn't get babies because it was sent to them so if it was sent for them to think about sex that passed it on to us NFL result of that we got a very warped idea what sex is about in in our lives but it but yet it's an integral part of who we are nearby motels on procreate General sell the Earth but yet they are the ones that renounce that and yet they pass it on to wash one of the stories I told in my book is about we have inclinations like any human beings if I if I like a girl I like her looks. You know it's an attraction it's normal normal magenta remember this this guy passing a note to a girl and a nun call them hold a grudge.. I thought that was the end of the world she was yelling and right now and then call another none these two people were put in front there and ridiculed for just passing a note in expressing how this boy like this girl so that's the kind of thinking that we went to I'm not going to cry today because I've done my crying if you want to cry and laugh that's fine now I told Chief here did you ever see Jesus smile did you ever see Jesus laugh come on I'll just think why is that is he a happy person or a miserable person because we were endowed we were told that Jesus is the savior he is God and all that Mike yet why is any smiling why is any happy why isn't here hugging children so this is something that I want you to think about the punishments that we got at residential school it bordered many times on torture and if you want to try one punishment ride home tonight take to take books go in a corner imagine your six seven years old your hands like this and see how long you can last and if you can't last that you got strap that's torture to me but yet they they said that that is punishment to me it looks like it's torture my sister is supposed to be here but she hasn't come in yet but when she started residential school one time in church I looked at her I got punished what you looking at my sister I'm about nine years old I wasn't looking at girls out just looking at my sister but yeah that's how they characterize and your look it's sinful you know everything we did was sinful I want to take too much of the time here I got I got a lot to say but I'll have my book say it for me this book I wanted used in schools in my area Northern Saskatchewan and I want people to remember I was up in the email as a cheap one time and they were talking about treaties this was the third meeting that I had attended as chief of them about treaties over the work order was chairperson so I told him you know what this is the third time upset with you this is the third time I hear the same bullshit you're the same place you're internalizing your own problems we go out here and that's it you don't talk about it you don't call you don't try to influence others I said from now on get the other people here get the other white people we signed treaties with them let them come into the circle and see if we can convince them that the treaties what means something so at the same thing as there are some non aboriginals here but the age group the ones that are in their late teens or early twenties are not around I know we're doing a good job in a sense that even there is totaled said if you want a person to changed to do something get them while they're young and guess what they did to us they got us while they're young that's why we're like that so that's what you need to do and then I told him a story they were in this mother had a little girl four year old little girl and she's out playing like a little tree four-year-old and then at supper time she called them her daughter to supper she washed her a little and then she came to the table and they were eating and all of a sudden and the little girl mommy Yes dear where did I come from no you know as mothers that's one question you don't want to hear and everybody's stop there looked up in you know it shut up mother said well dear if you finish your supper with tell you where you come from and a living so they finished their supper District wasting time trying to get their dishes and everything taking it easy hope you should go to bed early but anyways done work out like that so by the time it was finished it was waiting in the living room watching TV and when Mom and Dad came in there Xian Shi shoe with the other little kids out there they go to watch go upstairs go outside so there's a little girl sat on the floor and mommy and daddy started their there they're their little spiel about where she come from mommy loves Daddy you know that birds and the bees in all the states and the little girl is sitting there you know mouth open eyes and our son mommy you understand there you know and she should not have a clue what they were talking about what they were trying to it's right where she came from song finally after they tried their explanation well then the mom ass now. Why did you ask that question I was playing outside and my friend Melissa said she came from North Battleford thank you
