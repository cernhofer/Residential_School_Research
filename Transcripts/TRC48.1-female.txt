green light's not on yet but my introduction would even take 20 minutes I'm talking fast and we my name is Margaret I am I'm crazy up and I'm from the water Hidden Lake First Nation I've been in 4 different residential schools for nine years every first one I was that was Blue Bell student residence up north then I went to the breath or three years grades one two three great for I did it st. Anthony's in Union Lake and five six seven eight I didn't say Michaels in Duck Lake I have lots of negative memories of our boarding school but also have good memories good and it was bad to the school and I am and I do know there comes a point in time when somebody says we got to heal and we are survivors and we can't be victims anymore but that is a journey it is a journey that you have to take and it takes a lot of courage I am I have really you know I had um I came from a family where we were very isolated our community lot of trees were Hunters gathers were people who'll and very hard-working people very good people but I was also a I am a social worker I had agreed social worker and I was working towards a event she won work towards a master's in sociology I really took to Sociology university cuz he's really that's where I really started an understanding about what happens about you know the residential schools being a tool of the colonizers and you know of and then it may be made me understand better just how the church affected not just the First Nations people but every every continent they were in every country they conquered there's a very similar history and and I'm iced up my am and I can tell people like all the boarding schools I went to I made a lot of friends that maybe I would never have known I met students from all over the place people who spoke different languages that I would never have known had I not gone there you know but also on the other hand when I was going to school it was what I was in university that I really understood just how we were form they wanted to you know or must you know they wanted to Fort before must Indian people into these into white Society say we never could so will you were trying to begin yet but we are also being raised by white people and to be functional in the world and you know it and I must say there's people on my travels like when I was in school there was it was the good nuns it was the good priest there's also the bad priests and a bad month they were there I remember this one this one yet none when I was an onion Lake should we leave took to me just to make me help her you know she teach me skill shoes to take me to the kitchen and she's to talk to me she must sense that you know I needed someone there she was really good and I remember if you still have she thought the other nuns were treating me bad she would go give these other and then she would take off for me you know but I seen a kind of this lady that that really helped me through the rough times and I remember when I was in boarding school in labret boarding school we also had this white lady who'd come work at the school she did seem stressed but she she was such a kind soul I mean I really thought the people that helped us survive shit such a kind soul always had it you know she always had a good thing to say you had such a grouch yet such a gram motherly Instinct about her and I always your mother I always think of this lady and she's probably long gone into the spirit world but I remember the very first residential school I went to was probably the worst it was it was Blue Bell it's just north of where I live in 4 years I could never think of this place without their just meeting a really dark cloud and you're such a really dark building probably where I experienced some of the worst in the first time I was separated from my mother you know and being bullied by other students some of the worst treatments I got it work from just the other residents that were there and it took me a long time to find out these people were lonely they were they were miserable they were not happy and that's why you don't they were bowling and doing other things and name-calling that's some of the worst name calling I've ever experienced was in the boarding school and that first year I got every sickness a man is about man and I got Mom I got chicken pox I got the flu and I got ear infections that I got sick about every every sickness imaginable but up in the things that stay in my mind is just we never got I never got proper care you know maybe give you aspirin and never went to the doctor you just stayed in the dorm I bought you soup wants them all and those you've really really tough times when I was that young and it was until so I went to doctor a car that was I was great five six seven eight and we were integrated into the Town School of Duck Lake so we got so we go to school with a lot of them went to the town school with a lot of white students and so we did have access to people and we went to school with a lot of people from the reserve beardies and I still have many good friends from those days a lot of good friendships that I made an experienced a lot of kindness when when I wasn't exactly in st.michaels that was when it was less and less control from the church it was more Indian involvement like Saskatoon Tribal Council took over school and so you have more reading and staff so I got to see the positive man I was in that Lake we had very good that we had very good school programs we had very good sports programs and I've seen a lot of really good soccer teams for kids to play soccer that's coming from that's cool but not only that I was upgraded and we had a I like I said Lord leads we played in Sports Forum and when I left that's why I went to metal like I went to a white school and they were really impressed in that school they were really impressed with how I could play store not so I either school you know what that positive thing heads up I know there's times that I never really I told my start my daughters here with me to ask her to come and I've told her pieces of my story I've never told her completely everything my parents were products of the Indian residential school and that they race that sometimes in a very strict way it was very rigid sometimes it seems really hard sometimes really we didn't get that loving that I thought we should get you know but saying that to you know I see now the harshness our communities lived in times were hard you had to work you had to chop what you had to hunt you had to do things to survive and you need to learn those skills to survive and I it wasn't till you know I started some of that healing was until I was in is finishing high school that I did I recognize that I had a rage which region side door is my mother because you know in my own distorted way I am I really felt she was just possible for me being in school and her not being there all those years I thought you was responsible and the I could not believe that bridge it was so deep inside you're taking me a long time long time to get to ever in my mind I was until I started you know some therapy and somebody told me you know what your mom was a product of residential schools your mom cannot give you what she doesn't have to give you your mom doesn't have it you know your mom has her own issues she never heal then as and as a child you had parents for not healed they were not well
