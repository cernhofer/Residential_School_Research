I know for me might might might might just if that's what you want to call it is it's my healing that's my money for me anything else it's about healing it's about continuing to heal my circle my family Circle it's about continuing to men not only my spirit but for the sake of my children and grandchildren I am I have ensured a lot with my son's I have my sons are on their own now and and I haven't really shared a lot with him because I've always felt that I wanted to wait till they were a little bit more mature in life and it's definitely not because I've been the perfect parent but I would my children were small I always remember the day that 1o School drinking I have come home and my one sister who's babysitting his hold me my son was a window crying for me really painful to hear but I'm grateful to this stage with all this because I gave me flashbacks as well because I remember those kind of days been home for days for months with my siblings and no adults around and being raised in alcohol and you don't like my sister here says being open till at predators hardest part of that was lot of his family and that's really scary what ever happened to me I I guess it was meant for me because I remember that might baking my help just help you get sober because of scared and scared me too know that I can take my kids to that seems like home you scared me so that begin my journey at that time I'm from letting go of lot of things and one of them was my my using and I'm grateful to this day that scared me so I began to really at that time I began to really take a look at that myself I love my children so much for that I was willing to do anything to come out of the cycles and today I'm grateful I'm so grateful helpers it took me awhile to get clean it to me a few years but I did it Andover Maine clean Sensen I'm grateful for them it's time to keep speaking out it's time to stop being silent about the trauma that we all share and that's why I'm okay I had my reservations about sitting here in front of a camera but it doesn't matter where we sit in the circle when you share your healing and you share your truth it doesn't matter where it is because I believe the helpers are always with us the blessing for me and being part of something like this is like I had shared earlier than when they first had this so I did go to honor my dad and my uncles and aunties because I have seen the trauma the residential school when my dad before my dad left my mom had a cyst to go sit with him in the hospital we didn't want to really difficult thing to do because all still really angry but you know what we were blessed to have a kind loving mom she didn't go to residential school funny she tells me a story that she wanted to so she can be there friends remember thinking thank goodness she never went my dad went and saw we suffer those effects videos of angers me because we have to pay the price we didn't but I work today I don't question lot of things that I do have a lot of faith in like I said I simply just keep doing what I need to do that here and part of that healing for me is is speaking out not because I know that when it comes to that word incest is still a lot of time there so I message it all shares for me what I've learned is that's where the shame stays silent it don't matter if you come to the circle and share and whatever way you choose to heal whether it's from ceremony or through church it doesn't matter you need to find a way to heal and when I was growing up in a different city with my brother and I run away from foster home and we ended up living on the streets for six years and we congregated with a lot of the I don't know how I would say that I guess you know with all the people that were in the streets and and assoc the people that were gay that sticks in my mind all the time because the more I learn about him the more I learn about II swear to beings as well and they have their own them so I'm just going to generalize I thought they have their own specific names many of them are gone now but some again that was meant to be even though it was a really painful time to be connected and be together and it saddens my heart that because of this interference over teachings many of our people have lost that respect for the to spread of people and that's another thing that I'm in so much pain about but I guess I believe you know that time will come on it's my turn off and that we find our way home again to who we are and our tree spirits and in our purpose and meaning so I created them all the time all those helpers that are out there and in the spirit world my relationship that I have with greater and my helper is it that I understand is what keeps me healing absolutely that's what keeps me healing in closing I am I love you all thank you for being here and I I encourage that we continue to heal and honor and love one another in a good way because love is the only thing that's going to help us heal
