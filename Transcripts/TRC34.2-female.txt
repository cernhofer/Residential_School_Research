have some pretty horrific stuff in residential school the other thing for me on my own personal healing journey I was an alcoholic I also did the drugs I did not leave a lead a good life so so with my own healing Journey as a youth one of the things that I had to learn was about my parents who they were so what I did was on there was an actual the first residential school gathering in my area I went to I attended and as I looked around there weren't that many youths I was probably one of the only youth at some of the sessions that we're going on listening to the stories of the survivors and when I listen to the stories of the survivors that first time light bulbs went on in my head a lot of light bulbs cuz you know what growing up I did not hear I love you imagine watching you know as shows like I was not sure with Beaver Cleaver Leave it to Beaver in Leave it to Beaver and here and you know I love you and seeing the nuclear family and in seeing that all the time how people express love you think why don't my parents left me because they're not saying I love you I never heard I love you I never got those hugs that I seen on these these shows I never receive. And I used to think my parents did not love me but you know what I learned at that residential school meeting if they did love me but they just couldn't say it that wasn't there when they have lost that ability to parent and I learnt that that day and that helped me to understand but they did love me except they showed it in different ways remember growing up we lived in a lift in a house without a toilet we had outdoor toilet we also there was 7 of us in a crowded 2-bedroom house and I a lot of times that was so it was pretty hard do you have your own privacy but you know what my dad would always say at least we have a roof over your head and your bellies full and that you're you're wearing clothes that fit you that you don't have to get from your older brother he said she should be appreciative but I remember my dad making the best meals ever and that was the way he showed his love for me my mom used to say or do you want me to go get you your favorite to your favorite chocolate bar or she would do something that would Express her love she had a different way of showing her love it wasn't always I love you hug hug but it was a different and I had to learn how they expressed their love I also had to learn how my parents were as human being they weren't just my mother and father they had a life before they became my mother and father and this is something that I had to learn about them in order to learn about me where they came from who their family was why they do this I learnt so much about time how they came to be the person that they were and that really helped me with my Learning Journey with learning who my parents were as human beings so I could imagine my dad as a as a little little person it was it was hard but I did hear that time he had a very disciplinarian father and was very disciplinarian and it affected some of the ways that that he he parent whereas he was was not much of a discipline but he was more of a teacher which was great for me he was he would show us stuff and we would we would have to do it in order that was the way we learn so so that was some of the things about my own Journey as an intergenerational Survivor in the way I healed again it was taking advantage of any opportunities that I could to learn also having nurturing the warrior in me and understanding the people that I come from like learning about the residential school system learning about the history that's where we have to start we have to start with our own self identity and Beast become strong in our self-identity and that's one thing that I have nurtured in my own two children is fostering a sense of strong self-identity for them they know who their grandparents are and one of the things about me is I'm the youngest in my family I was a young mother teen a teen mother and my parents you know what they did for me was they actually took care of my daughter and gave me the opportunity to go to school to get educated so I went out and I got an education and then when I came back it be enabled me to work while they looked after my daughter and when they did this they supported and encouraged me and when they supported and encouraged me I realize that I have a role to play with my parents because they were taught the old way where are we going circles so from that point I got a great education I had a great career I've done so many great things because of these teachings that they provided with me and believe me it was no easy Road sometimes I Stumble I fall but it's up to me to decide to get back up and it's that warrior in me it's a look at our people are Aboriginal people and I think of a time before before I contact pre-contact and how the the I guess Turtle Island twice how Turtle Island was before contact and imagine our people survived in such harsh environment for such a long long time and when I'm not averaging people came to our continent they discovered there was a lot of game Still Waters weren't poisoned it was a good place because we all lived in Harmony and in balance with our environment we only took from it what we need and that was something that I really respect about our culture and that we should be proud of I look back and I always say to my kids when prior to contact there were no big ancient cities or or polluted Lakes when when people came to this land it's because I knew how to take care of it and live in harmony with it and each other so it's that time that I would like to share about healing because I didn't want to forget them and I thought they were very important one of the things that I'm doing now is some my parents who are elderly both live with me and I took that as my role I believe and rolls and families and that's what we used to have traditionally we would have both and that is one of my rules as the youngest daughter is to take care of my family they help take care of me and my children so now it's my turn to take care of them and I also have two disabled brothers that live with us so I was blessed to be able to earn an income I was blessed to be able to earn a large enough income to buy a big house in this big house accommodates all of us and so I'm quite fortunate that that I was able to do that and with their help with the help of my parents I wouldn't have been able to do that so now it's my turn to take care of so the cycle has come around as well as my children I have given them a role as well I have always told them you are here to learn and you'll meet a bunch of teachers your grandparents right now are your biggest teachers because you have access
