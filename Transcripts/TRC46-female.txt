2 minutes the afternoon or good evening it so I'm falling asleep here I'm really tired cuz I was like A3 hour difference so remember I come from its like 8:30 my time now my name is Lonnie Johnson I come from Mom eskasoni Cape Breton Nova Scotia and that there is some at the other end Cape Breton I was in residential school when I was nine came out when I was 15 I was out for a couple years between age 13 and 14 and what my mother just didn't know what the time when she signed us in because some of the older ones had gone it was that the once you sign in your children you sign over all your relinquish All rights parental rights to your children so when we came home for the summer we stayed home for two years so I guess they were missing us so the priest and now I'm one of the other ones came back in June and told my mother that the rest that myself and my sister I'm a other two brothers me on your sister would be going with me going back against Denver I'm a mother I think always maybe he felt bad about this but never really am talked about it we talked about it and we so upset her and we never knew why and I think going to sense we used to be kind of mad at her or upset that we figured that she was getting rid of and it was not tell them we had a conference in our community that the percent to their ass too how many of us went to the school it was nine of us my family that went to the residential school in the ass me is your mother still alive as if he has a cyst you think she'd want to come in now I'll ask her so she came in after dinner and now I never talked and he asked if he was mrs. Johnson why did so many of your children go to the residential school and I guess nobody ever really asked you that before but what she told them was that the Indian agency RCMP in the when they came to the house they told her that too many children it was 13 of us and at the time my mother had cousins that had tuberculosis and her children were with water it was for other children besides us and I think that was like 17 of us at home at that time so they took the younger ones everybody of school-age they told her that if we didn't send the children to the residential school that she would lose her rash back then I guess traction was flower tea molasses sugar send me a few other things so we I never could understand why is it because we had Gardens we had chickens we had a guy I thought we were pretty well-off you know we didn't have running water and everything but I don't remember anybody being hungry or anybody being colder dirty I thought we were all right and the residential school a lot different than what I thought would be at first it seemed like a great adventure we're going on this train right now you know just turned green anyway but we got there in the first night that was like you get into recreational nothing maybe the size of this room and what you had to do was take your clothes off it in the shower come out and then you were delayed and you got new clothes and and you got a number the number that I remember was 47 and I became 47 over 47 was before me I think I inherited everything that went with number 47 and that was mental physical sexual abuse Tobit and this went on until I was 5th like 15 maybe 14 1500 back the second time I'd like the residential school taught me was to survive I guess to be angry I hate a lot of people I ended up hating myself and I never realized all of this at the time but it wasn't until years later when I had left I became alcoholic I lost my children that and then they returned home 18 years later I came back to the community and now I wanted to fit in so I joined this prayer group and I became a cold for the church I done reading site on the whole bit annum and it that went on until late I think one night and 90 something when they both would have written a book on them out of the dips before that I was a reader in church and I remember reading that one night it was a Wednesday night and then the first reading was ever start of the dips and when I seen that I couldn't I couldn't move I couldn't say nothing and it seemed like maybe 5 or 10 minutes to me but was probably five seconds I don't know but I read the reading and I told a priest I won't read again and Isis if you asked me to read again I won't be back so the next week I was on the bulletin and I just didn't come back and it wasn't until Isabella but her book came out that I think was at the summer that that she helped me when I left at school I had nightmares for 39 years and it was with her help and now you want to talk and circle with her Factor that helped me and I at the time that the nightmares stopped I don't have them today thank god well I have occasional funny ones but the not exactly nightmares and type things and for that I seem to think I was all right again and then I was asked again you know that you think about residential school bus group coming in from the Archdiocese of a teenager paper and I said oh yeah yeah sure I can do that and we got there and we're in a circle like this and I don't throw myself on my goodness I hope there's no priests or nuns here I got scared and when it came my turn I said holy I just good evening I'm number 47 and I cried and I cried I cried for two days and was like I couldn't stop crying every time I would stop or wake up I would cry again so that's when I figured like number 47 had better start healing so wherever there was healing rooms river that was healing taken place that's where I would go and it was like you are tornadoes people and for me that's where I found you and for myself I know it's hard here for a lot of people to come in this week and even like now it sometimes it gets emotional it seems like everytime I come to these conferences I hear more but each time people are beginning to get a little bit better there's a little less pain is a little less hurt and I find out for myself to a beginning to a it doesn't seem to matter as much what matters now is the children our children our grandchildren n I'm hoping that by this and educating our people and the people out there people like me on this will begin to heal nothing starts with yourself your family your neighbors even Chief and Council people around you and I've always learn to I think maybe reconciliation I can pretty well understand it and it was one of the gifts that my mother left me asset never to be angry at a person no matter what they did and at 4 it took me a long time to understand that and in my heel and I have to see it that way as well I couldn't hold old church the whole non-native community is to blame but I did hold the people responsible of certain individuals to me these are the people that did it and it wasn't everybody else because I know a lot of times we all somehow get misjudged her mrs. Appleton Olive actor it's a real honor to be here with everybody today and I'm grateful I never thought that we would actually sit here today and all and no from the time we begin and when we first I think Matt Med was Matthew Cohn come all I wanted was for people to know people to know the story of these schools and to know what happened to the Joker and I used to talk to the in different schools but it was always about the children native non-native all children interview find poverty or people but have problems you find a lot of abuse and so that was just what's the children act as part of today I just wanted to thank everybody for the opportunity I didn't mean to speak I told my story quite a few times I have many stories but that's another day I just want to thank you
