my name is generational my father is half black and half feet from Montana he's a boarding school survivor my parents suffer this damn what they went through as children they suffer from addiction and I have little or no relationship with them because the system put them through my children were removed from I care for issues that had nothing to do and no reason to remove my children what can I do I lost myself for a bit I felt heart I had to pick myself up and start fighting for my babies I pray to the great spirit and I cry and show me the right path in the right direction I need to go to get my children home the ministry for Children and Families has asked that I go to a detox I completed that I have a certificate 2013 that I complete a parenting program 2013 I'm also seeing alcohol there and everything and I have letter support from the community basically what I'm trying to get at is over 50% of all the children in Canada in foster homes are of Aboriginal ancestry to this day our Aboriginal children are still being placed in homes that have little or no knowledge of how our culture is we need to be where we need to wake up we need to see the genocide of our children and our culture is still ongoing to this day I've done everything that has been asked of me and more the ministry to extend the removal of my children they have no reason our children are being lost over 50% of our children are in foster homes today are Aboriginal and are being assimilated someone must speak out for a children that are still suffering I'm living proof that the system is failing us I've done with a past and yet they won't give me back my children I was hurt the most when I came to visit my girls and their hair was chopped they're going to church every Sunday that's not my believe that's not my way that's not my children I want them to the way my ancestors prayed and Southfield it looks to me like the residential schools are gone and some are even torn down but the system is still the same in this day and age to see heading of the children's hair and taking them to church and make me sick to my stomach I wonder who the real victims are the target is our children to assimilate our children what good is the money is for children are still suffering the most precious gift a woman can wear around her is the arms of her children hands off our children hands off our land thank you
