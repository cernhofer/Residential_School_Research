probably won't be able to have kids and I just did that life was not for me but when I found out about residential school still partly blamed I didn't know what happened there I didn't know anything I know why I didn't know anything because the elders Michael, my mom and them didn't want to talk about it why do they want to talk about it I don't blame them today or anything I'm thankful that they are there it may not be perfect but I know them I know I don't know my language I'm clean and sober today 11 months today I'm going to school today I have 7 kids and total but I have for that are with me three that are out was my creator and no my mom didn't want to come here she's at you with me here I really need to really got to say is that I see the pain I see the hurt of the people that are young I know so much people that went through a lot of things I have but even worse I honestly felt like my story was nothing compared to anyone else is that I hurt till I told somebody they said you have something to share share it and make it be known and I am an outcome of residential school but only I can change that with the future generation with my children I told my children every day that I love him the things that my mother and my father couldn't do for me I'm doing this for my kids because I believe they deserve it and it really can only start with young people with change I just truly believe that I want to be a part of breaking or cycle of residential school no the pain and anger and hurt
