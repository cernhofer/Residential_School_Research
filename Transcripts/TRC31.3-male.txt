looked at myself and yes I know I'm a kind of you all these things are wrong but I didn't know how to have any feelings or to pick them up but anyway I changed my life with I quit drinking and I started helping people in my community and looking up I've always said looking at life different you don't have to change look at it differently and I and I've been trying to bring the residential school issue to the beautiful in my community try to keep up as much as I can and what was happening in terms of residential philco he had a residential school right in our community our Gordon Indian School who was almost a heart then the economic Drive of our community before and having lived in Muskegon at the hacker residential school from 8 to 8 years old to 16 years old 17 years old you become a community within that community does there were four other Indian families that were there and there was about 8 of us those boys from that family if you went to town or we went to a sports and the reserve we were kind of Outsiders we went to town we were Outsiders if you want to meet a community or at we were Outsiders and we have to stick together and you talk about games nowadays well there was groups like that before I don't want it would they didn't call her games they call this bad boys and that's the way it was and that's what developed in Gordon there was the south end the Roman Catholic the middle was the people that sing power and were considered the Pagan and in the north end where the Anglican and then there was a group of Born Again Christians that Brenda somewhere in the middle we were as Roman Catholic within the pagans cuz my mushroom was considered they're not going to church guy on his wedding certificated has the whiskey remarried Pagan Indian didn't even a man but there were two people that same power Union and did they give away downstairs and on those kind of things but as I grow I try to be cuz I thought the school can serve a purpose but I also wanted as a leader within my community to bring the focus of the school to say hey we can change things that happened there if we just talk to each other don't force kids to come there uninstall came there and I work there I know those boys that came forward in the Lady Di's and I tried to bring it to a community leadership and saying hey that man is doing something over there wrong I work there is a childcare worker and I put the kids to bed and I come back and check and he take them home or take them into another woman and I told him hey I'm as possible for those kids you leave those kids alone well after you're off work Eddie I'm responsible you go home
