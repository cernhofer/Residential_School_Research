good afternoon my name is Roberta bear and this is my mother Ruth Cameron I am fortunate to say that I did not attend residential I was I guess if the word is the others I guess there's two ways of looking at it there's always two sides of a story but at eight months old I was taken from my mother's care and um I was in my grandmother's care and I was raised by my grandmother and I feel that it's a blessing in disguise I had two mothers I was gifted with two mothers my mother my grandmother I thought was my mother until I was about the age of 5 and when I got to start meeting begin meeting my my mother and my my little siblings and it was my older sister and I that were taken from my mother's care in to my grandmother's care but you know I try to look at it from a good point and I think that she only wanted the best for us because she she to her son was raised in residential schools and down she didn't have an opportunity to take care of her son and be there for her son her parents took her son away from her and them raised my dad and my dad grew up in st. Philip School and I never knew about residential schools until my first year of University and didn't really connect with it until I was in my dad was teaching me how to play Crib one time when we were used to come and live in our home off and on cuz he was an alcoholic he would go find he'd be working in Thunder Bay or wherever I don't know he worked all over the place but when he used to come home I know I just knew that was in a lot that air lots of fear lots of drinking lots of them running away in the middle of the night banging on the doors you know he's yelling at my grandpa's are a lot of memories that I share my dad and after he passed away button Nightmares From My from my father damn I love him though and I feel bad that he's not here today to share his story I know it's probably a horrible one but I'm glad that I'm here for my mother and able to speak on behalf of my my father when he was sober he did do good things with us sorry is getting lost a little bit here the only thing I really remember about my dad talking about residential school with how he mentioned um I'm mrs. Lambert didn't and I didn't really know anything about where you went to school and stuff like that and he mentioned and I just kind of said with who is mrs. Lambert niece of mrs. Lambert was a priest was the priest in the school and a 12 years old you don't really think to ask who this person is or even what it meant to tell me but when it all kind of came back to me when my first year university when I kind of figured out for some odd reason he shared that little that little piece of information with me for me to connect something about his past about something about why he would call this man mrs. Lambert and this was the priest at st. Philip school that's all I knew then so I kind of start asking some questions and you know within the community will my grandmother always took me back home to sundance's and I was always near her when we come visit the old ladies and hear about some stories in on the community and I kind of learn about who this mrs. Lambert is and you know and he was a a sexual predator too many of the boys and in the st. Philip's school and a lot of people didn't really want to go beyond saying that that's it you know you know you just say you don't know how to talk about those kinds of things you don't know how to communicate about those kinds of things cuz you pretty nasty things to talk about but my dad died when I was sixteen and died in a house fire you would drinking and he fell asleep with her cigarette in his hand and house burnt down or them but it is very damaging sweeting's really get to say goodbye to him cuz he didn't get to see him off the casket was closed then from there on we um I kind of grew up not understanding life always felt that it wasn't loved by my mom you know unfortunately drinking drinking was a pattern in my life I found a husband who is an alcoholic and I became one too Kmart method appealing or Giants and so are just guys aren't you feeling I hadn't done took it took alcohol for my mom and I to actually have a conversation a confrontation cuz we did not communicate my mom wasn't taught how to communicate and her truth and so I wasn't taught my grandma taught me to be quiet about things and you know how I was taught to respect not to speak not to ask questions but just to listen and I respected that I never never was one to talk about to my grandma or any any of the elders or anybody older than me but at the young age I run away from home and thought I found love but whatever whatever it was it was but I am continue down the cycle my mom had her first son at Seventeen I had my first son at 17 but it was a cycle I didn't want to continue onto I didn't want to protect you and continue on in my life I didn't want to give up my kids to anybody to Mom you don't any kind of system or didn't want my children raised by their grandparents I wanted that responsibility and I'm proud to say today that I raise my children I am am not may not have been a perfect mother and I know I'm but not and I'm still not today and I'm still learning and I'm still trying to understand I'm still trying to help them be good people help them understand why this is all this why we are the way we are and it just took me this last I took them I continue taking classes at University cuz I like to learn and dumb I was really angry from January to April when I was taking my class very angry at white people and didn't know how to deal with this anger and I had my mom to talk to I had my mom to communicate with and I just felt like I didn't belong anywhere I didn't belong in my own home because my children couldn't understand my husband doesn't understand me now my husband's about a respected person in the community and we don't think I like we don't think I like it all but had besides the point to him but the I have the have this anger that I have to get over and I'm very um IVIG before taking this class I understood the importance of trying to get along and tried to be community in trying to be respectful of each other where whoever we are and and I'm getting there I'm getting there but I did I did have a lot of anger and I and I had to do with that anger out if I didn't deal with it I'm not going to get anywhere I'm not going to get anywhere being an angry person so you know I feel good about them being here at the deer see if it felt good about visiting piercing in Victoria and being a part of the region working group committee it was a it was something that worked really hard at trying to ensure that our education day was something that was meaningful for children because it's our children who are future you know my children are going to grow up to share this information with their children my grandchildren one day and I hope my grandchildren are a lot healthier than you know my children they are healthier than in all the way I grew up there's just so much some dysfunction you know there's so much loss you know why I don't have my language you know it but I can get it back if I fight choose to it's not that easy it's not easy to find those conversations going on I'm still very much involved with my culture though I find it so I called her that brings me peace and Harmony but I do falter I do like to go back in I mean old old old ways are are hard to our heart to them give up some time with her old habits are hard to die and die I'm just really glad that my mom and I have had an opportunity to openly share our thoughts and and become who we are today I look at my mother my mom is my mother my respect my mother she's like my best friend like I can tell her anything and to me that's all coming full circle to me now I want my daughter to be able to hopefully then chili feel that same way with me because you know my daughter is a broken person they wish you was here my children grew up seeing violence and lots of alcoholism to and I feel bad and guilty for that I got it take those years away but all I can do is let them know that I love them and that I'm sorry for the things that they've seen sometimes we live we learn I don't mean to do that cause anybody any harm but sometimes it just happens that way I just want my children I want to I pray for them to change a pray for my grandchildren to live healthy lives they don't have any yet but that day will come I'll be there for them and I'll be strong and I just want to say thanks for giving me an opportunity to speak I didn't think that you know
