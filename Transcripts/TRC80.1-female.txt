hello near me I've always been scared to speak but I am just a little few years I've been speaking I'm very very scared but that's all I got to say about that I didn't even I was on the I'm going to say things just not going to talk about if you send it back I went to the Eminem's I was George I'm from to Oakland from here to Fino and I'm I went to school and that was for eight years and one year I got sick and grape 5 but I really really had with Mark that's all I had and I was surprised how my marks were that's all I get through with work real hard in school cuz everything horrifically worse military and I hope it's at a school and I'll just say a few things about that up it's at a school paper scissors there was molesting the school and it was very military when we would get sprayed by raid because if we were sick or if we have bugs in your head you know it was around though it was horrific in or the smell of that and I actually block this off about the rate and one day when I was older we just can't win and I sell my car I got the realtor lock in theme song and I block molesting off and I'm working on there remember because the body always remember what happened and I never ever and pray and it's very hard not to cry but I'm crying inside since day one anthem doobie I don't want to say this but my parents were in residential school and it was horrified going home to from the day school it was just like residential school and I'm two people to see it you know how many times have we got to know only got a lot of bad and not everything turned out to be like our parents and pass it on to our children and our grandchildren my dad right now things to say but I am working through it I'm not forgetting about at dinner we don't forget the wood I just then went to residential school in Port Alberni and I also have blocks there but I'm starting to remember I was barricaded and raped and molested all night but I'm still remembering are having their hand on my mouth I can talk about that but anyway um I took a drug in this residential school and blacked out immediately that's why I can't remember though the barricaded anti-rape I'm going through it and I am remembering the my body is remembering and I will be going to court probably in a year from now it has been horrific for me and um I've been really quiet person and unable to speak and I'm scared of people you know I am called myself ugly since day one and today I still think I'm ugly and stupid I am working really hard on not calling myself ugly anymore and I've been doing that for a while and it's still very very hard and there's so many things that need changes I especially want to mention that our children need to be protected our children aren't protected in these courthouses and I am very very upset and I want this Truth and Reconciliation or whatever whoever's dealing with it to do something about our children they're being molested and they're being torn apart and he's courthouses and I know because my grandchildren are having panic attacks at five and six years old and don't nobody I believe the courthouse over 2 years anthem things have been changing for me and that I would like to say someone that'll help you know with asthma asthma hasn't been very kind it's just like a residential school of the way they treat our children it's the same thing over and over in the courthouse is a more one-sided unfair and this is important pretty I'm sure it's all over the place but I totally believe my grandchildren and I really am suffering and we're supposed to get them back not to the courthouse and it is going to be through the Creator and the answers there said my grandchildren are going to be returned to mother my daughter and I pray every morning and every night in my own words to the Creator because I was also brainwashed in the soap it's at a school I was on forced into Catholic religion and brainwash that I'm going to burn in hell you know and there's a picture this girl thinks a disciplined as you're going to burn in hell
