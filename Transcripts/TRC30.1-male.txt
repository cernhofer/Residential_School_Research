morning first of all love I would like to thank the Creator for giving giving us another beautiful day today another day to walk on earth Mother Earth and I want also want to thank the grandfather's the grandmothers and all the spirit helpers that they come to help us everyday to try and live a good life and walked it Circle the crater had given us so I brought my meat sauce with me because currently off the government told me I was making when I went to residential school they line me up in the main area where that I thought it was a human so get that I don't know the government says I'm 18 but the media - this was given to me by now though and the way I understand it is you need to learn the metis sash soul to another I thought that the ironed it was a woman older and she presented it to me when I was at training and kind and a guy and Mohawk Country Inn Ontario High and that's where it was presented to me so I keep it close to me it travels very much because part of my healing I do role-plays I play Wii sahita I don't know if you know who is a key to his it's like really big brother in the Free World I think some people call them none of those there's other words that describe me as well so but he's our big brother he's our Jesus so I do role-plays to keep the stories alive in the winter time with my friend Curtis and we go to schools and they try to role play the role plays in the school so this is traveling very far many schools across the couch in Alberta and Manitoba thank you so I also brought my own personal smudge because yesterday III spoke a little bit at that one of the main areas in and I found that it was very hard to find it anywhere in this place and I thought for sure that there should be a smudge of ailable but that's not up to me so so so I thought I'd break bring my own this time in case I do need it so it's here in this little bag that was also given to me by now though first of all I attended to residential schools and I am the second youngest son of 14 children August 3rd until I lost my little brother but I'm the second-youngest at this point in my parents are still living today and I'm very grateful for that my parents are 89 my dad will be 89 next month and my mom just turned 87 and they're still living at home healthy and supporting each other so I got very good role models and we we are um they are practicing very strong practicing Catholics and I and that's okay because they're praying to God and my mom had told me that doesn't matter how you pray you're praying to God whatever you call them creator so I went I attended all across the first of all and I went from living across the lake to order community buy a Beaver River there at 4 o'clock is what they called it and I didn't know I didn't go to kindergarten till I was 8 years old because my parents knew what the residential schools were about so they pushed the limits I guess we'll see they wouldn't send us until the government people come and told them that you have to send them so that's why I didn't go in till I was 8 years old and I feel that's what that's when do that part of my life story I guess starts but before that I have a goal and that goal it's basically to try and get myself back to the way I was from birth to 8 years old to be for residential so I was very happy have a lot of good memories I learned a lot of things I was very close to my parents but I did yours all that came to an abrupt and so I've made it a goal like a some trying to used iPod positive positive sort of way on the negative stuff that happened to me and I work and I work in a Penitentiary and I'm used to circles I'm using circles because I feel so that they programs there and I stick with her my brothers that are incarcerated right now so as I sit there we do a lot of exercises including collages and doing the life stories when I do that I take part with him I know a lot of people in the counseling field say that it's not right well I tell them I want to do it the way I want to do it I meant somebody was talking about Emanuel here and a book to me I've been doing this for 8 years and I can actually say hi I can actually I keep track of the guys at take to program the ones that they come back into jail in to the penitentiary oh there's lots that have not come back and you can tell the ones that have really taken on a journey so they have not come back and I'm hope the best for them but I guess my life from eight years old on is not a good area and it's tough to deal with high didn't start dealing with it until I was 33 years old from 8 years old to 33 years old I carry that with me for a long time and I basically tried everything I could to avoid thinking about it talking about it but I know it was affecting my life by very much and hi I went through a lot of fun different things including the substance abuse of all kinds of one of the areas that I always was ashamed of and no shame to talk about was the fact that all of my children are from different the mothers and and I didn't realize that until after I after a while and I'm not using it as an excuse but I didn't realize that some of the effects of being abused how sexually abused as those types of things and I can't remember that word that they use for it the promiscuous I thinking I guess that's what you call it but I'm in today I've tried my best to do to heal and to heal the relationship with my children I have my oldest son is. 29 now and my second oldest is 26 will be 26 actually so what I told him as I sat them down and I told him my life story and I explain to them that's what I went through when they were old enough when were they were both 16 and I asked him I said to consider it I'm not going to tell you not to use alcohol you make your own decision but also be prepared if you're going to be a dad you know because I was not and I wasn't able to give you a good parenting like that should have been able to put but I did the best I could not have a very good relationship with my son's at this point and they've given me a grandson and granddaughter but I guess that's what we did to realize is we need to talk about those things that that hurt and it's painful and I realize that but the more I talk about it the less painful it becomes but as I said I cured it for 25 years and I was tired of it and it was affecting my relationships and respecting everything then today I can look at it I can look at it as my strength actually it's made me who I am today and I think I believe that I'm strong I believe I believe I can beat it I can deal with it and have a positive life and actually achieve my goal which is that first eight years of my life that I don't know if I'll get exactly that way but it was a good life but it was all taken away it's good though because I understand that and I was victimized at a very young age Lunette 25 years I didn't realize I realized today that I kept myself as a victim I was me that the kept myself there but I didn't know I didn't know how to move out of there and then after 25 years when I began to talk about it that's why I became a survivor and that's one that's when I felt that sense of relief just not releasing my all of that that I carried cause me a lot of pain that time and I'm unable to go back now one of the piece at a time and try and mend was one that if he's at a time today I was thinking about being sexually abused causes sexual confusion and then that at one point I didn't know what I what what do I get to how I felt sexually and it doesn't work that way it causes lot and nobody wants to talk about especially when they don't want to talk about that I'm here and I build up the courage to talk about
