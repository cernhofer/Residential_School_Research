good afternoon you got over there with me I'm fighting a cold and a lot of words I know I spent the day before sharing my private story and I know it took a lot out of me took a lot of my voice in my dream and I still feel that I like no there's never really onion 2 who said we have to deal with it now we're going to deal with this important my name is Ruth Cameron I'm from originally from the coast First Nation I married into a bear diesel classes at this time and I have my children here with me my daughters are you Roberta was there to support me close by I have my oldest daughter and Daddy and my baby daughter I need to so I really feel her to have them here with me today I want to begin by sharing with you telling you where I am and it's cool I was five years old when I was taken to the back residential school my mom took me in with my other sister and that's all team members my other sister and my other older brother and my other sisters I went to different schools than I did if they went to Maryville and then after that he went to some of the residential schools I can't recall and my little baby sister she was in the same school with me for a little while and I don't know after she went it is very hard when I go into the doors I could hear Children Cry and I didn't know what they were crying for so I just by trying to be taken my sister jumping I remember all the names two sisters that took care of me there and I'm Number taking us at the stickers to Calder small girls playroom and there was lots of other little girl sitting around and you were crying and I didn't know why you were crying all I know was I started crying for my mom because I seen her leaving and I didn't know why I was there new members also to a sister put in some money inside of a little black money box and that was for me to use when I needed to buy things I was there from great pre-kindergarten if you want to call it because I wasn't old enough yet to go to kindergarten I played in the sandbox and watched all the things going on in the classroom from a glass window and I could see my sister play all right if she wasn't paying attention I see her I see you're getting old buddy years and strap-on and not listen to sister my sister always protected me she was old and in with the Sea of course she's a bit older than me I just a year and she's a very quiet girl and I was the very active one talked it was so you know I never forget the strong relationship that I had with her because she took care of me we did home economics and I was in the crates or so you know she always covered up for me should finish my sewing for me cuz I was always getting hacked and I was getting punished for it just for me so it was just a little nun but you very very very mean I remember seeing my little sister sewing and she got her hands the needle went to her finger well operating the machine and die because that happened to her sister Misha was over a home economics teacher took her and strap your hands because of this happening to her I always try to remember the good things but it's pretty hard when we don't get to really talk to each other as sisters Robert Edwards ESPN punished or try to run to each other and help I remember when we have track and field meet my sister it was not a good runner she was little women Iowa said later in life she's a little woman she's a little sister she was just everything a little woman needed that was a little tomboy so I remember seeing running track and field in I'm yelling for her around in the rain running the rain the curse should get hacked and you know and did not laugh at her because she was a good runner so then I get myself into trouble because I was really bossy and very aggressive so you know III take up for her and then of course I would get better but it was locked in your closets all day or having to say the rosary but I remember state in the closets many times state with the stinky boots and winter time in the shoes the closest looking out the window that was there our meal time was terrible we have bologna made it to soup we had cards Panda Inn in there we do have little balloon is about the size of my young fingernail in my area and I would cut them into little pieces and put them in the water and oil to Bologna and that's what we had for juices for brought so we had to eat that and that was a very calming meal for us and if we didn't eat it you know did take it and bring it right back to us and we have to finish it in the matter how cold it was we have to suffer and another thing I remember carefully was it a real pathetically was always wanted to be in charge of being able to clean the sisters dining area because they had great breakfast did have bacon and eggs and toast and oh my gosh if we had a chance to do that because we we were greedy for it because every day with me that was flop porridge and toasting sometimes sour milk to use on her porch and we're really really you don't forget about and in the fall we'd always go Harvest corn and tomatoes always stood out for us because for me anyway because we eat that right till about November when all of the food and ran out the vegetables and the thing I never forget is in the kitchen area they had a pantry and in the pantry they had lots of canned fruits and pickles and what it is time for us if we wanted some fruit we would have to get money from The Middle Bank box that in the money that our parents left us and you know I know I know we were very poor at home so you know it is really sad because later in life I realize the government the food to give us in here we were spending the money to buy that that's fruit for a treat and you know I mean I know my parents were very hurt we were poor and you know it and I feel guilty for having to spend money that my parents gave me that my my you don't my kids work so hard for end there's something there was a lot of you know and if we had to read and if we didn't read well we were left that and the history books with terrible because it number sister would say 2 or so okay that I survived if you had time to read and then do a little history books I never forget it was an Indian he was dancing around the fire and sister are great to sister would take you as they survive you know and this is where you know I really start becoming more and there's a boat or I was because no one ever told me to be a problem girl to be a proud girl I remember free word listing it true Chuck Sarah and the sad part was either our own amongst ourselves are our own people our own young kids all of this you know we make fun of each other because we were making out of two so we laugh at each other's mistakes there's no respect for each other snowbound is talk
