so I went to my my leader at the time and I told him this was happening there in all this time I didn't know that he was also doing that he was part of that group of abusers actor there and a guy came to our community and found those kind of people in our community and put them in positions at the school Dune Abraham for about 14 years to stay in that kind of and that kind of situation anyway so frustrating and just stay calm and member of the community who was the shit disturber that they hate week we gotta change that and the frustrating part again is that after star left one of those people that was was part of his group of abusers became a leader of one of our programs and I brought it to the leadership and said a disguise was removed from the school for doing this to girls Eddie you can say that kind of stuff mini look around the table and you'll see two other people that were part of that that comedian that said he had to get away from the school earlier rostam hey you were there with me when we set a table and said he had to leave mmm with in that Community like and I say as a residential school student Survivor our community in a residential school in the community so different then I think I'm going to wait as an individual we're very similar as a community with a school it never leaves us and then when this thing came out that Wendy this dialogue started I went and shared my story I shared today cuz I shared this with my with my wife long time ago and when I told my wife I never shut your eyes to learn and nothing in about 6 months later we were having a quiet supper in I just fell apart everything just hit them I cried for about an hour I'm not a thing like that no and then she understood let me know so I was 45 when I went to my mom and dad and told them I asked him what happened and they told me why we have to go there and I never hugged my dad or my mom and and I hope them the first time that day so I've been involved with this residential school stuff trying to support people in my community trying to understand this settlement agreement and I and I really get low support from these things but as a Survivor and a community helper we lack so much and understanding what does deals about like us as First Nations people we look at our healing but it's all there's a such a larger thing that affect what for doing that paper. We signed and we got this money from we don't even know if there's this thing in my community Now call the personal credit stuff people at my community expecting money in your pocket and abused ourselves all over again and each other who do you think you're already saying I'm not going to get the money okay then it says right there are no cash value who was the advisor helper in a survivor he kicked around again by the same people you're trying to help in school totus this fight about healing and moving on is a continual struggle these things I think are really good but we need more after that we need someone to come and help us talk about this other stuff at a community is I'll go home and I'll get kicked on again for mentioning what happened to me and what happened within my community with my Community member give those people that abused other people in our community are still there understand doing that what does coke and Dagger stuff so that's my story of my residential school experience and and and sometimes I want to leave it over there but it's a part of me so I take it with me and everyday I ask the Creator to help me move forward we we have a teepee that starts with little Indians coming out here with all joy or sooner than go around the back in and Ender beat up and then you come back around like that then in at the beginning these old people said sitting together that we have it in Korean and English Miss I said together and we talk can we we we we have good things and we listen to each other and we make good plans with winning those good plans are going to be hard times and then when we move in on this side it says moving beyond but when we move Beyond those hard time then we become good people again Henry are good people all the time we just need to understand that so moving forward as a First Nations man in the residential school stop sharing with my family and my immediate partners my my wife and my kids my kids know my story but I don't take them with me to these kind of things I talk to him at home and I tell him trying to help them understand about being alone yourself I have one son who is very cold however he is learning to do do I tell each other we love one another he was home last weekend and when he left he said I love you Dad man old as I am. Give you a gives me a lump in my throat and I shouldn't have to be like that but I'm learning and as when I listen to old people talking this way we learn every day and just accept that the grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change courage to change me I'm doing that Plattsmouth that's my experience so I'd like to thank you for listening to me
