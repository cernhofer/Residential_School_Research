thank each of you for sharing and as each one was talking to it reminded me a picture of parts of my life each and every one I think we all carry a little bit of each other stories maybe not the same I know I was in residential school for three years but sometimes it feels like it was through it it was a long time when things happen and I remember younger kids crying you could hear them crying at night sometimes and you had a brother or sister summer behind the wall but you couldn't go to them that would done until I left there and live in the residential school I went to another school or into another convent not calling when I left there I thought it was going to come out and be a nun I suppose the only thing I knew I wanted to be a nun but it ended up Ryan. I landed in Boston I'm sorry I met a person he was really nice we ended up getting married and I was pregnant next one three months after you got married that's when I started to get beat up that continue until 1969 I ended up having to place my children for protective custody I went to court for six years never got them back he became an alcoholic and also a drug addict whatever and it was like starting one day and then stopping one day when it was nothing left to lose that's what I felt so I stopped and now all I had was like what I had on my back of me the clothes and SOB bag I had a few things left so I work tonight I went and I went back to school late and then I move on I move back to Canada and I figured from here are you know I am back to the community anaconda versus Catholic medical community and trying to fit in I ended up going back to church I had gone to church in 20 years and they got the residential school how many came back was trying to fit in fit in with my mother my family I didn't know my family it was 13 and my family but neither was went to the residential school then I got married a second time I always like to Joe as I was happily married on he couldn't deal with it I have my son and now he was seven years old and finally we have we lived in the car for 2 months till we got an apartment but I suppose I'm like having a second chance but I couldn't do nothing for my other three girls they felt like with my son I want to believe and we're still together me and my son he's 25 today and he's a pretty good follow-up prices of living in the community and trying to work with residential school survivors my main thing was survivors in it and I think my kids grew up with them I have a daughter that came home when she was 16 she came back in back of the community I didn't we didn't really know each other I knew she was my daughter and she knew where she was I was her mother and we fought for about 13 years why I left your way I'd honestly I don't know find me when I was going to KMart I was sick and she came in and she says I feel like you're hitting you or whatever and I was about to take your best shot but I'm not going to guarantee you I would hit you back by get up but I say so we can sit down and talk so he said we talked for about 4 hours does anything you want to know tell me are you know whatever our system I'll answer you but it was like I had to give her that time too for her to tell me what she felt how she was feeling and Ice is like a everything I did it was true and so I don't know but I also told her that the time I visited that was all I could do but I didn't handle things the way I should have liked instead of getting help I ended up drinking and drinking more and it went on till when I get to stop but I've been sober now for a nano 30 something years and if you had told me back in the sixties that you be sober and working in an addiction Center what is that are you crazy but I'm I've been at the Addiction Center now for 20 years and I said I've been pretty lucky guy says that my young my boss is allowed me to go to he'll have to find other survivors and today I work with residential school survivors I've been working there for I don't know how long me and now my friend here we were our own little support group I think there was 5 of us in the beginning we have potluck and we go to different communities meet with survivors and then residential school process everything started happening and what we tried to do was kind of update everybody on what was happening until it's brought me here and now that's why I said I still haven't gotten around to my IEP yet one of these days I guess that'll happen I've been in it with the door Bernard new beginning in 1995 when we started 95 oh my God like quite a while now I'm 15 years like that and still so haven't had a hearing in the beginning like I said before this I didn't expect compensation but I want people to know what the stories stars that wouldn't happen to children to the families to the people in their communities and I said sometimes when I talk I don't really have to talk too much further than my family we have everything in my family we had a lot of a lot of sickness whatever a lot of sadness like you and I said to him when you have a large family of 13 or 9 when presidential School you come back and you're really affect the community big time I have one of the workers say the color should be whackers when we come back please come back Miss beat up on people as that was the only thing we learned was out of sight and how to defend yourself and I thought that racing it is it was another way to fight and I was to help people to try and help others and I said I see all of the things that are happening still today in the community not the alcohol the drug the abuse it happening Family Services still taking children a lot of abuse still happening sometimes it gets discouraging and what are you do who helps where you go but I see so I can't give up and I like a lot of the other those of us that are still here today I was told one time that we're not survivors anymore we've become Messengers we need to laugh talk about this and share these experiences with other people so other people will know I know what happened to our people I want to thank you Brave women for coming here today
