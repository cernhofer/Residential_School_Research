Alvin the filler doesn't cuz I was asking to make I'll just let me know G well my older siblings so I went to residential school I myself the knot the summer I was born my family in and two other families have moved from where they were living at the time and moved to start to a new community sometimes I think about I think about that maybe just wondering the reason why my mom and my dad did that was to move it to a safer environment and that's why I grew up and I went got there my father a Delta and my mother about the little Log Cabin that's what I've been there and it was and that's where I grew up and we didn't have electricity your or school or a store and there's ink station for a long time where I grew up in a place that was a safe and happy environment and I think my parents so sometimes I do think them whenever I see them they're still alive today for doing what they did but they allowed me to have you raised in a chameleon like that the star recently I was asked by the the TRC to to go work with them and the work they're doing Honda I considered the what was being asked of me and then and looking at the number of survivors that are out there that are still alive today and looking at them size of the country and considering the the challenge that the commission has to reach all the survivors no matter where they live it seemed like a daunting task it seemed to almost intimidating tophatter I thought to myself and I talked about this with my own family my wife had to say and I even sat down with the our children even know they're there only five on the oldest is that n I love to this was when I was being asked and he said yes but we felt we can do our own little Parts in the work that the that lays ahead and I guess that's the other commitment that the Commissioners and the staff that the TRC have to all the survivors at 2 even though we have a limited amount of time left we have a limited amount of resources to work with that we will give it our all that we will do all we can to finish the work that that's been given to the commission and that we will do everything humanly possible to fulfill the mandate and then I just wanted to share briefly and I don't want to take too much time here than just that when I started the TRC couple weeks ago a staff meeting at the officer in Winnipeg and I didn't really stay locked I just noticed that back and then the chicken I would was being discussed but one of the things that struck me about the meeting in about the organization was just how small how small it is in terms of the number of stuff that I left at your sea employees and I thought to myself you know what the only way that we can do this is if we work together first of all as a as a commission with all the stuff that we have there but also it to go out and create a Partnerships and relationships with the with the survivors with the families with the communities with the leadership and with organizations that's the only way we can do our work and that's why I just wanted to I think you for being here yesterday and then today and tomorrow and then we will work with you and the Europeans want to send as a closing as I've heard comments about even the elect of the event that was held in in Timmins said the TRC has come and gone and that said that's it I think the message that we want to convey to you too to you with other survivors out there is that is not the end I think we look at it as a beginning of a working together and then I thought I seen that relationship with deal with the survivors of that we will do come back and if we are invited to to the communities we will do everything we can to Toyota, Dayton accept those invitations Midway American document oh my God tell you Buick headache and I know it says give me on occasion with you gave me two guys know that merits conducting our is a care my mother never forgets
