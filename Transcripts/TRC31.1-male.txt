Attend residential school I didn't know until many years later that my mom and dad had tried not to send me to send me and my sister to that school and I'm going to jump all over I've been I've shared this for a long time and each time it's not any easier than the first time when we went over there my dad went down during the summer and then we moved it to the summer was coming to an end and I and one day when school started all the kids were starting their rides there and we thought we were going to go to the town School and that's what the talk at are at our table and then one day the the priest came and we just left about 50 yards from the school and I thought behind the school room my dad number or my dad lived and I am just mama's home in the priest came and said well they were talking and then he went outside and my mom told me to go and get done my my daddy was working at the bar and had animals and stuff like that there so it was it was it a good summer working with the animals and chickens and pigs and everything else so I went around for my dad and then came back in I didn't know what was going on so we came back and they were talking and my sister were standing beside them and then I was listening in mistaken remember that just sort of did you start Road k91 walk-in way in Vienna re-stuff me by the hand and said I have to go with him and I liked it I was just going over there just to go with them and then my mom told me that while you guys are going to go live over there now and I didn't want well I'd I didn't want to go and yesterday I was watching a film there and there's little fella is taken by his is taken by a priest from his mom and a nice time I see that that that that that feeling you get kind of a knot in your stomach in a lump in your throat because you know after about five or six steps you going to look back and say hey somebody somebody on when are you say you're not going I'm only you look back in my dad is going to the barn my mom was walking away it says I have seen I've ever shared this story many times I needs time.
